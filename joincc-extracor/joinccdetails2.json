    "content": "Science has since time immemorial been looking for ways to say something about VO2max without a laboratory setup. It should be mentioned that 50 years ago it was thought that VO2max was poorly trainable and therefore a great predictor of sports talent. In this article you can read more about this and what exactly VO2max is.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThere are actually two ways to distinguish in these calculations.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\nBased on maximum effort, as in a 5 max all-out effort (1) on the bike.\nBased on a submaximal effort, as with the Astrand Nomogram (2) or the First Beat calculation (3) common in Garmin devices.\n\nThe first way is actually the most accurate method, right after, of course, direct laboratory measurements. After all, here you measure the maximum output and then calculate back to how much energy the body needs to produce for this. This is how we know that a person’s maximum 5-minute value is highly correlated to Vo2max. Through this way, no standard corrections have to be applied for age and gender and these errors can be avoided. However, you do actually make assumptions for efficiency and (cycling/running) technique. Still, these formulas turn out to usually explain around 95% of the variance, which is often acceptable in terms of margin of error. (1)\nOn this page we have a calculator that you can fill in yourself to determine your VO2Max based on your cycling power number.\nBecause humans are lazy by nature, there are also calculations where you do not go all-out. These methodes are usually based on the ratio of power or running speed and heart rate maximum values. These types of formulas extrapolate the ratio and apply corrections for age and gender. The best known way is Astrand’s nomogram from 1954 (2). This uses a line drawn between heart rate and power output from a simple submaximal test to predict Vo2max. This method has been improved and validated many times over the past 60 years (4/5) and still seems to give reasonable values. Fortunately, this graph has now also been converted into a formula, which you can use using the calculator in the link below. (5)\nHow this test works and how to use this test yourself can be found here on this page.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe Garmin calculation\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe method used in Garmin devices today is basically an updated version of the Astrand method from 1954. Unfortunately, Garmin’s exact method is kept secret. So we don’t know what correction factors for age and gender are used, nor what the exact formula is for extrapolating heart rate and power. We do know that this calculation requires you to have at least 20 minutes of power data with a heart rate of 70% of maximum heart rate or higher. This method is said to be quite accurate, but thus not very extensively validated in science. The accuracy of this measurement is said to be at 95% in running and 92% in cycling. These are very nice values and in almost every training you can then make a prediction of the Vo2max and follow it through time. (3/6)\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTo conclude\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe question remains as to what exactly this value says about a person’s cycling capabilities and why not extrapolate, for example, to maximum power values or running speeds. Then you can avoid any discrepancies in the standardized corrections for age and gender. In addition, the power outputs can be used in determining the appropriate intensity in future workouts, whereas you can’t really do anything else with the Vo2max value.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVO2max calculators\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tBut to not leave you completely empty-handed, here are two calculators with reference to the scientific evidence.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tReferences\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\nSitko S, Cirer-Sastre R, Corbi F, López-Laval I.

    "content2": "# Science and VO2max\n\nScience has been searching for ways to estimate VO2max without the need for a laboratory setup. Previously, it was believed that VO2max was not easily trainable and thus served as a significant predictor of sports talent. This article provides more information on this topic and explains what exactly VO2max is.\n\n## Calculation Methods\n\nThere are two main approaches to calculate VO2max:\n\n1. **Maximum Effort:** This method involves performing a 5 max all-out effort on a bike. It is considered the most accurate method after direct laboratory measurements. By measuring the maximum output and calculating the energy required, one can determine a person's VO2max. This method does not require age and gender corrections, but assumptions regarding efficiency and technique are made. Despite this, the formulas used in this method explain approximately 95% of the variance, which is generally acceptable in terms of margin of error.\n\n2. **Submaximal Effort:** This approach involves using formulas that extrapolate the ratio of power or running speed to maximum heart rate values. Corrections for age and gender are applied in these calculations. The Astrand Nomogram from 1954 is a well-known method for predicting VO2max using a line drawn between heart rate and power output during a submaximal test. This method has been improved and validated over the years. A formula based on the nomogram is also available for easy calculation.\n\n## Garmin Calculation\n\nGarmin devices use an updated version of the Astrand method from 1954 to estimate VO2max. However, the exact method and correction factors for age and gender are not disclosed by Garmin. To perform this calculation, at least 20 minutes of power data with a heart rate of 70% of maximum heart rate or higher is required. While this method is considered accurate, it lacks extensive scientific validation. The accuracy of this measurement is reported to be 95% in running and 92% in cycling.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe value of VO2max in assessing a person's cycling capabilities remains a question. Alternatively, extrapolating to maximum power values or running speeds could avoid discrepancies in standardized corrections for age and gender. Power outputs can also be utilized to determine appropriate training intensities. VO2max calculators based on scientific evidence are available for reference.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.
