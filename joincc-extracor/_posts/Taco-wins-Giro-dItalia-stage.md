We are still stoked about the wonderful stage 3 victory of Taco van der Hoorn in the Giro d’Italia 2021, where he managed to stay ahead of the chasing peloton after a solo breakaway. A victory we are especially proud of at Cyclinglab as we are both the personal trainer of Taco’s and the cycling performance partner of his professional cycling team Intermarché Wanty Gobert. Unsurprisingly, we were on the edge of our seats, biting our nails and ecstatic after he managed to pull off that feat. Below you can find the link to the post-race interview with Taco by the guys from “In het Wiel” (sorry, only in Dutch).
