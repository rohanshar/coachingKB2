Why use zones?
What are the underlying physiological processes in the different zones? The body basically has three different energy systems to create ATP, which is the energy that is needed for muscle contractions and thus your ability to run or cycle. The systems are the creatine phosphate system, the anaerobic system and the aerobic system. The first is mainly used during a sprint and is exhausted after about 15 seconds of extreme exertion. After those 15 seconds, the anaerobic and aerobic systems take over.
The anaerobic system can generate a lot of energy in a short time but does not last very long and you have to adjust the intensity after that. The aerobic system uses mainly oxygen and fat as energy sources and is therefore the system that will deliver energy for the longest time. So for long efforts, like cycling, it is the most important energy system.
On the other hand, all energy systems will work side by side to release energy. Depending on the intensity of an effort, one system will work harder or less hard. At low intensity, almost all energy can be delivered by the aerobic system, but as the intensity increases, the anaerobic system is used more and more.
