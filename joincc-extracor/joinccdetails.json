    "content": "Science has since time immemorial been looking for ways to say something about VO2max without a laboratory setup. It should be mentioned that 50 years ago it was thought that VO2max was poorly trainable and therefore a great predictor of sports talent. In this article you can read more about this and what exactly VO2max is.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThere are actually two ways to distinguish in these calculations.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\nBased on maximum effort, as in a 5 max all-out effort (1) on the bike.\nBased on a submaximal effort, as with the Astrand Nomogram (2) or the First Beat calculation (3) common in Garmin devices.\n\nThe first way is actually the most accurate method, right after, of course, direct laboratory measurements. After all, here you measure the maximum output and then calculate back to how much energy the body needs to produce for this. This is how we know that a person’s maximum 5-minute value is highly correlated to Vo2max. Through this way, no standard corrections have to be applied for age and gender and these errors can be avoided. However, you do actually make assumptions for efficiency and (cycling/running) technique. Still, these formulas turn out to usually explain around 95% of the variance, which is often acceptable in terms of margin of error. (1)\nOn this page we have a calculator that you can fill in yourself to determine your VO2Max based on your cycling power number.\nBecause humans are lazy by nature, there are also calculations where you do not go all-out. These methodes are usually based on the ratio of power or running speed and heart rate maximum values. These types of formulas extrapolate the ratio and apply corrections for age and gender. The best known way is Astrand’s nomogram from 1954 (2). This uses a line drawn between heart rate and power output from a simple submaximal test to predict Vo2max. This method has been improved and validated many times over the past 60 years (4/5) and still seems to give reasonable values. Fortunately, this graph has now also been converted into a formula, which you can use using the calculator in the link below. (5)\nHow this test works and how to use this test yourself can be found here on this page.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe Garmin calculation\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe method used in Garmin devices today is basically an updated version of the Astrand method from 1954. Unfortunately, Garmin’s exact method is kept secret. So we don’t know what correction factors for age and gender are used, nor what the exact formula is for extrapolating heart rate and power. We do know that this calculation requires you to have at least 20 minutes of power data with a heart rate of 70% of maximum heart rate or higher. This method is said to be quite accurate, but thus not very extensively validated in science. The accuracy of this measurement is said to be at 95% in running and 92% in cycling. These are very nice values and in almost every training you can then make a prediction of the Vo2max and follow it through time. (3/6)\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTo conclude\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe question remains as to what exactly this value says about a person’s cycling capabilities and why not extrapolate, for example, to maximum power values or running speeds. Then you can avoid any discrepancies in the standardized corrections for age and gender. In addition, the power outputs can be used in determining the appropriate intensity in future workouts, whereas you can’t really do anything else with the Vo2max value.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tVO2max calculators\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tBut to not leave you completely empty-handed, here are two calculators with reference to the scientific evidence.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tReferences\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\nSitko S, Cirer-Sastre R, Corbi F, López-Laval I.

    "content": "VO2max is a measure that indicates the maximum capacity at which the heart, lungs and muscles can absorb oxygen. This is measured in liters per minute or, in the case of weight-bearing activities such as cycling, in milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.\nThe concept of VO2max is shortened to “V,” which stands for volume, “O2,” which stands for oxygen, and “Max,” which stands for maximum. So it indicates the maximum volume a person can take in oxygen within a given time interval. It is a crucial detail to understand that this is the maximum amount of oxygen that can be used for energy-generating processes in the muscles. It is not the maximum amount of oxygen that can be inhaled or transported, but rather the maximum amount of oxygen that can ultimately be used by the muscles after uptake.\nIt is important to note that while VO2max can be a useful measure of athletic performance, it is only part of the story. VO2max focuses specifically on the ability to take in and use oxygen, but does not take into account other important aspects of athletic ability, such as muscle strength, endurance, technique, tactics and mental toughness.\nVO2max is an important indicator of a cyclist’s physiological capacity, but you cannot take it as the sole measure of success. In practice, there are examples of riders with very high VO2max values who did not necessarily become top cyclists. This highlights that while VO2max is a crucial component, cycling performance does not rely solely on physiological factors.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIs your VO2max trainable?\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tThe VO2max can indeed be trained contrary to what exercise physiologists used to think. Because humans are very trainable aerobically and the VO2max says something about the maximum aerobic capacity, this is actually quite logical. That is why we also see in the research literature that the VO2max is not only trainable with high-intensity blocks around the VO2max, but also with long easy endurance rides. In the end, the right combination of the two will cause the most progression.\nIt is also important to note that while virtually all people are aerobically trainable, the degree to which VO2max can be improved is, in many ways, determined by the individual’s genetic predisposition. Thus, some people may see greater improvements than others, but practically speaking, any form of regular physical activity that is challenging to the cardiovascular system will lead to some improvement in VO2max.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhat is a high VO2max?\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tAlthough VO2max can vary based on several factors including age, gender, athletic background and general physical fitness, the following values are generally accepted in the sports world as indicative of a high VO2max:\nAverage male cyclists typically have a VO2max of about 50-80 ml/kg/min. For elite professionals, VO2max is often found much higher, with values closer to 70-85 ml/kg/min and reportedly even higher than 90 ml/kg/min in some notable cases. Below is a overview of rather exceptional values. We do not vouch for the quality of these values. Perhaps also important to note is that high values from people who have once achieved otherwise athletic feats are likely to go unnoticed by the general public. This is also known as publication bias.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHow to measure VO2max\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tMeasuring a VO2max is usually performed in a controlled environment such as a sports laboratory. During this test, the load is rapidly increased in a so-called ramp protocol. The goal is to reach a point within a short time, usually between 5 to 8 minutes, where the participant can no longer continue. This involves measuring oxygen intake and output through a breathing mask and breath analysis equipment.\nAt the beginning of the test, the tester makes an assessment of the person’s abilities to correctly set the rate of load increase. If the effort is increased too slowly, there is a chance that the participant will become fatigued before the true VO2max is reached.\nWhat makes the measurement specific is that one measures the concentration of inhaled and exhaled gases, namely oxygen and carbon dioxide. This is done by analyzing the participant’s breath each moment. This gives insight into how much oxygen is taken up and used for energy-generating processes in the muscles.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPercentage of men by age group VO2max in (ml.kg-1.min-1) (1)\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPercentage of women by age group VO2max in (ml.kg-1.min-1) (1)\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhat good is knowing what your VO2max is?\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tActually, not much. With a very low VO2max you will not be able to become a professional cyclist, but with a very high VO2max it is not said that you will become a successful cyclist or athlete. In fact, it is just one of many conditions that determine how good a person is athletically. In addition, if you do regular VO2max tests in a laboratory, you could measure whether your training approach is working. At least if the goal of those workouts is to increase your VO2max. Beyond the fact that this would be a rather limited training goal, there is also the question of what sport this is important for. More interesting in cycling, for example, is how well you are able to convert that Vo2max into power and ultimately speed. So it is actually the world upside down to convert power or running speed to VO2max, so that VO2max can then say something about one’s athletic performance.\nIf you still want to calculate what your VO2max should be approximately then we explain everything about it on this page including a few tools to get started right away.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tReference values VO2max\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\nKaminsky, Leonard A.; Arena, Ross; Myers, Jonathan; Peterman, James E.; Bonikowske, Amanda R.; Harber, Matthew P.; Medina Inojosa, Jose R.; Lavie, Carl J.; Squires, Ray W.

    "content": "Indoor cycling, such as with the EnduroCo Workout player or on platforms like Zwift are becoming increasingly popular. The trainers from Tacx or Wahoo are in short supply and not without reason. Indoor training today is much more like outdoor cycling and, just like outdoors, sports nutrition plays an essential role in your performance and recovery. However, how does indoor cycling compare to outdoor cycling in terms of nutrition?\n\nThe Unique Challenges of Indoor Cycling\nIndoor cycling differs from outdoor cycling in four fundamental ways:\n\n1. No riding wind: This means you sweat more because there is no natural cooling.\n2. Constant pedaling: There are no stoplights or traffic to stop you.\n3. Movement is more static. You basically only use the lower body and in exactly the same way with each kick. Therefore, for those muscle groups, the load is heavier and more one-sided than outdoors.\n4. More intense sessions: Indoor workouts tend to be shorter and more intense because of the above factors.\n\nMoisture loss during exercise\nWhen indoor cycling, you can lose up to 1.5 liters of fluid per hour, depending on various factors such as humidity and temperature. Maintaining proper hydration is crucial. As soon as you lose 2% of your body weight in fluids, your performance can already drop. If you lose 5%, the drop can be as much as 30%. Now, an 80-pound adult male does not lose 4 liters of fluid easily, and certainly not in a one-hour workout. Yet research shows that a mild dehydration of 1% of body weight already results in an average deterioration of 5.8% in a 5km uphill time trial. Without a good fan and the windows wide open, you’ll have this in no time in the last 15 minutes of your Zwift race.\nMinerals and Hydration\nThe importance of electrolytes\nWhile sweating, you lose not only fluid, but also essential minerals. These minerals, often referred to as electrolytes, are crucial for muscle functions, and a deficiency can even lead to muscle cramps.\nChoose the right sports drink\nDrinking a hypotonic sports drink is recommended during indoor cycling. These drinks have a lower concentration of dissolved particles than blood, allowing your body to absorb the fluids and minerals faster. Keep in mind that from a good hypotonic sports drink you will not absorb more than 700ml to 1 liter of fluid per hour. So if you lose more you will build up a fluid and mineral deficiency.\nCarbohydrates: Yes or No?\nAlthough your body has enough carbohydrates for about 1.5 hours of full exercise, some studies suggest that the body performs better when it thinks it is getting carbohydrates. In a study with Colombian loggers, they were found to be able to chop more wood when the body thought the drink contained carbohydrates than when drinking only water. Therefore, during longer sessions, it may be useful to use a drink gel with carbohydrates for better quality training and faster recovery, but for a 1-hour workout, this will usually not be necessary.\nStart Strong, Finish Stronger\nIt is essential to start with proper hydration and sufficient carbohydrates. After an indoor cycling session, even if you’ve hydrated well, you’ve probably lost more fluid than you’ve absorbed. Therefore, it is crucial to stay well hydrated especially in the first two hours after exercise. As always, keep the order in recovery of; hydrate first, then carbohydrate, then protein.\nSo whether you train with on EnduroCo or Zwift with your Tacx or Wahoo it is critical to adjust your nutrition and hydration to meet the unique challenges of indoor cycling."

    "content": "Indoor cycling has surged in popularity over the past few years, offering cyclists a way to train effectively regardless of weather conditions, and providing fitness enthusiasts a convenient way to engage in heart-pumping workouts. Whether you’re preparing for a race or just trying to stay in shape, understanding indoor cycling essentials can optimize your experience.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1. The Appeal of Indoor Cycling\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tBefore diving into equipment and software, it’s worth understanding why indoor cycling attracts so many. Here are a few reasons:\n\nConsistency: Unlike outdoor cycling, indoor rides aren’t affected by rain, snow, or traffic.\nSafety: There’s no risk of accidents with cars or other unforeseen road hazards.\nStructured Workouts: Indoors, every pedal stroke counts. This controlled environment is perfect for targeted, effective training sessions.\nThe possibility of using the ERG mode. This does also have its downsides. We explain all about that in this article.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2. Trainers: Your Indoor Cycling Foundation\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tIndoor cycling requires a stationary setup, and that’s where trainers come in. Here’s a breakdown of the major types:\n\nWind/Magnetic/Fluid Trainers: These are the most basic and least expensive trainers. They provide resistance using a fan, a magnetic flywheel or fluid resistance. Wind trainers can be noisy and offer less realistic road feel. Magnetic and fluid trainers are quitter and have a smoother road-like feel.\nDirect Drive Trainers: These are the top-of-the-line when it comes to non-smart trainers. You remove your bike’s rear wheel and connect it directly to the trainer. They provide accurate resistance and are quieter than most.\nSmart Trainers: These trainers can connect to devices and apps, adjusting resistance based on virtual terrains or training programs. They offer the most interactive and dynamic indoor cycling experience. Most of the Direct Drive trainers are also Smart Trainers.\n\nWe recommend to go for a direct drive smart trainer. You can get a Zwift Hub nowadays for less than the price of a (high-end) helmet. But also Tacx (a Garmin Company) and Wahoo offer a wide ranch of great high-end to less expensive direct drive smart trainers.\nAlso up for consideration is a home trainer without the need to put your outdoor bike indoors. It’s more like a trainer with the complete bike attached to it. The Tacx Neobike, Atom Wattbike or Wahoo Kickr bike are really the top of the line and you never have to bring your bike inside again, but they do come with a price tag.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3. Software Platforms: Enhancing the Indoor Ride\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tModern indoor cycling isn’t just about pedaling in place. Software platforms have revolutionized the experience by offering virtual worlds, structured workouts, and social connectivity. Here are some popular ones:\n\nZwift: One of the most popular platforms, Zwift offers a multiplayer online experience. You can ride in virtual worlds, join group rides, races, and even follow structured training programs. The software adjusts the resistance on your smart trainer to match the terrain.\nTrainerRoad: Focused on structured training, TrainerRoad provides science-based training plans to help cyclists achieve specific fitness goals. It’s less about virtual worlds and more about efficient, effective workouts.\nRouvy: Offering real-world routes, Rouvy uses augmented reality to let you ride on real courses while staying indoors. It’s great for those who prefer real-world visuals over game-like environments.\nSYSTEM/Sufferfest: This platform of Wahoo provides structured workouts with a mix of humor and high intensity. Videos, music, and storylines make tough workouts more engaging.\nJOIN Workout Player: And of course you can connect the EnduroCo Cycling App also directly to your trainer. This is the fastest and most efficient way to get you going.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t4. Setting Up Your Indoor Cycling Space\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tOnce you’ve chosen your trainer and software platform, it’s time to set up your space. Here are a few considerations:\n\nVentilation: Indoor cycling can get sweaty. Ensure you have good ventilation or fans.\nFloor Protection: A mat under your trainer can protect the floor and reduce noise.\nBike Protection: If you cherish the varnish and bolts of your bike, we recommend a towel over your cockpit and frame because the sweat can be pretty aggressive.\nEntertainment: Consider setting up near a TV or computer for easy access to your chosen platform. Be aware that following a complicated series is quite challenging during a Vo2max workout.\nHydration & Towels: Keep water and towels within reach. We have a complete guide about what to drink and eat when indoor cycling here.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t5. Reasons your power might be lower indoors compared to outdoors\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tWith all the information above. You’re set to go. However some of you might experience some trouble in hitting the same power numbers indoors as outdoor. This is actually a well known phenomenon for which multiple reasons, or a combination of all of them, can be the root.\n\nDifferent Power Meters: It’s essential to note that not all power meters measure the same. There could be a discrepancy between the power readings on your bike and that of your smart trainer. Ensure you calibrate your power meter before starting your training to achieve the most accurate readings.\nTemperature Fluctuations: Indoor training can lead to significant temperature variations, affecting your performance. For instance, the lack of wind and airflow can cause your body to dehydrate. Even a mild dehydration of just 1% of your body weight can result in an average 5.8% performance decline in a 5 km uphill time trial. Ensure good ventilation during your indoor training sessions and keep ample hydration within reach.\nStatic Cycling Movement: Another crucial factor is the nature of cycling on a smart trainer, which differs from outdoor cycling. Indoors, you often engage the same muscle groups more statically, while outdoor cycling is more dynamic, allowing various muscles brief resting periods in different positions. This difference can cause discomfort or even pain, especially during standing sprints. In such cases, a rocker plate can be a solution to enhance the cycling motion.\nMental Aspect: The absence of wind and real-world speed during indoor training can also pose a mental challenge. Cycling in a virtual world without the feel of fresh air and changing landscapes can be demotivating. Being in a slow-moving virtual peloton can also be discouraging at times. It’s vital to be mentally prepared for indoor training and find motivation to bring out your best.\n\nWith this information you should be ready to hit to virtual slopes of Zwift or follow your structured workout in the EnduroCo Cycling app on your Tacx or Wahoo trainer. Whatever you prefer there isn’t a proper excuse anymore to be slacking in the winter months. Because remember progress is all about consistency!"

    "content": "It’s one of the most frequently asked questions and one of the most difficult to answer. It won’t come as a surprise that the unsatisfactory answer is: ‘it depends’. It depends, for example, on your starting point, on how many hours you train per week, per month and per year and of course genetics (aka talent).\nBy Jim van den Berg, Founder & CEO of EnduroCo Sports\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tHow ​​much does someone improve on average in EnduroCo in the first 3 months?\nIf you start training with EnduroCo for a number of hours per week and for 3 months, what would happen? There’s only one condition: You need to complete 13 training sessions in total during these 3 months (= 13 weeks).\nThanks to aggregated data of EnduroCo this is a question that is much easier to answer. This should give novice EnduroCo users something to hold on to as well. As can be seen in the graph below, we have made a distinction between the number of training hours per week. Logically, more training means more progression. Progress is expressed in a EnduroCo Level. This score is a combination of a person’s FTP, weight and fitness level\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWith only 3 to 5 hours of training per week, the progression is already 8%. When the number of training hours is increased to 7 hours or more, progression increases to a whooping 24%! To translate this into actual power numbers, we also look at the improvement in Functional Threshold Power (FTP). On average, FTP increases with 12 Watts when training between 5 and 7 hours per week during the first 3 months (second graph). This may not look much, but a cyclist weighing 80 kilos will take 1 hour and 12 minutes to ride up Alpe d’Huez with 250 Watts. A 12 Watt increase results in a potential time improvement of 7 minutes.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNot bad for just 3 months of training, right?! Want to know more or give it a try yourself? Check out our website https://join.cc/ or get it in your favorite app store.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tYour EnduroCo Level\nJOIN cycling has one number, to rule them all. The EnduroCo-level! This score is a combination of your weight, your FTP, and your training level. This way you can easily measure your own progress and compare it with other cyclists.

    "content": "As a fanatical amateur cyclist, you would like nothing more than to take your beloved racing bike on your family holidays and discover new challenging routes. But you also want your family to enjoy the holiday and you do not want a divorce when you return home. A cycling holiday with the family can be a great experience, but not every family is up for that. In this blog I give you tips for a carefree holiday that will satisfy both you and the rest of the family.\nBy Jim van den Berg, Founder & CEO of EnduroCo Sports\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTips for a carefree holiday for both the cyclist and the family\n\nLeave early: Make sure you plan your cycling trips early in the day, especially in hot climates. That way you not only avoid cycling in the heat but you also have enough time remaining to spend with your family. You can use the morning for a more intensive workout and relax together in the afternoon.\nMake sure you have some energy left: You have less energy in the swimming pool if you completely exhaust yourself for 4 hours early in the morning. Take it easy for the last 15-20 minutes of your workout. For example, drink an espresso on the terrace before you get back to your holiday residence. That way you can still play ‘sea monster’ with the children as soon as you get home.\nThink about the family activities: Make sure there is plenty to do for the family while you go on your bike rides. Look for areas with opportunities for hiking, swimming, sightseeing, and other activities the family enjoys. Avoid ending up in the middle of nowhere simply because you have the best cycling routes there. Also think about what the rest of the family likes.\nCombine rest days: plan your rest days together with the family so that you can all enjoy relaxation and quality time together. So communicate well in advance when and for how long you plan to go for a ride. Then other plans can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe 5 best holiday destinations to take (or rent) your bike\nOf course this is a rather subjective and personal subject, but at EnduroCo we are not afraid to give our opinion. Good holiday destinations for cycling are:\n\nThe Alps: The breathtaking landscapes and challenging climbs are a dream for most cyclists. The Italian Dolomites in particular have the perfect combination of Italian cuisine and heroic climbs.\nMallorca, Spain: Known as a cyclist’s paradise with its beautiful coastline, quaint villages and varied routes for all abilities. The climbs are often no steeper than 5% and the asphalt is great. A little inland, the roads are not too busy even during the high season.\nTuscany, Italy: Enjoy the Tuscan hills, picturesque landscapes and historic towns. Be sure to take the strade bianche, or the gravel roads.\nThe Flemish Ardennes, Belgium: For those who love cobblestones, short, steep climbs and rolling landscapes, the Flemish Ardennes are a great destination.\nProvence, France: Known for its picturesque villages, lavender fields and hilly roads. It is a great destination for cyclists looking for breathtaking views and challenging climbs, of which the Mont Ventoux should not be missed.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFollowing your training schedule on vacation\nIt’s understandable that you don’t want to neglect your training schedule and intervals while on vacation. Here are some tips to keep you in shape, even when you’re on vacation:\n\nPlan your training in advance: Check your holiday schedule and adjust your training schedule accordingly. Plan your most important workouts and intervals on days when the family can do something else.\nTake advantage of local bike rentals: If you don’t have the option to bring your own road bike, look for local bike rental companies that offer quality bikes.\nLook for climbs in the area: If you’re in the mountains, take the opportunity to train your climbs. Be careful not to take on too much and take enough rest days to prevent injuries. There are also plenty of tips on seated and standing climbing.\nPlan your routes in advance: Do some research about the area and plan your routes. This helps you to better follow your training schedule and gives you the opportunity to explore new routes.\nFlexibility and Balance: Be flexible with your training schedule and enjoy your family holiday. Don’t forget that a gentle bike ride with the family can also be valuable for your training and promotes family fun.\nPut your bike aside for a while: The family holiday might also be a good time to temporarily leave the bike behind. Sometimes you need absolute rest after a cycling season, especially after achieving your goals. Then you can pursue new goals with good courage.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tFortunately, EnduroCo perfectly meets the above conditions. So you can continue your EnduroCo schedule while on vacation with peace of mind. Enjoy discovering new routes, beautiful landscapes and quality time with your family. Have fun cycling!"

    "content": "Every cyclist who wants to improve is looking for shortcuts: things that cost little effort or money but do bring an improvement in performance. In its heyday, Team Sky even had the term ‘marginal gains’ for it. The term was not new, but their aim was to emphasize a focus on details. One of the often-cited examples was a bike computer that connected seamlessly to the handlebars, so that there was no aerodynamic disadvantage. The assumption was that many small improvements could make a big difference. That sounds plausible, of course, but the biggest advantage of this way of working was that it led to a culture in which everything was questioned, researched, and improved.\n\t\n\t\t\tFactors that improve performance.\nUltimately, you can’t ignore the fact that nutrition on and off the bike in combination with training gives by far the most progress. However, there are factors that can improve performance. We gain insight into this if we disregard nutrition and training. Which things are there to improve performance and to what extent do they contribute exactly? The answer to this can be summarized in five categories:\n\nEquipment: Investing in a light and stiff bike that is well tuned to your body can significantly improve performance. Aerodynamic equipment, lightweight components and tires with low rolling resistance can further improve speed and efficiency.\nBicycle maintenance: Regular maintenance of your bicycle, keeping it clean and well lubricated, and making sure that all parts are in good working order, will help you optimize its performance.\nTechnique and skills: Developing good cycling technique and sharpening essential skills that improve your cornering skills and how to climb and descend well can lead to better performance. For example, consider joining a cycling group to (further) develop these techniques.\nAerodynamics: Reducing drag can make a remarkable difference in cycling performance. Especially the posture on the bike makes the biggest difference. Only after that it’s about the bicycle, clothing, or your helmet.\nMental preparation: Mental factors such as focus, motivation and strategy play a crucial role in cycling performance. Think of visualizations and positive self-talk to increase mental resilience and further optimize performance during competitions or challenging rides.\nRest and recovery: adequate rest and recovery are vital to maximize your gains from training. Allow plenty of time for rest, sleep, and consider active recovery techniques to promote muscle recovery (such as foam rolling or light stretching).\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBest marginal gains\nNow what if we make these options even more concrete and look at things that you can buy and for which you don’t need to put effort in? In that case, a better cycling position or improvement of mental preparation and cycling technique are irrelevant, and we only look at better material. So, what are the best marginal gains that money can buy?\n\n\t\t\n\t\tBecause we exclude that the condition improves, the improvements of these materials only affect lower air resistance, lower rolling resistance or slope resistance and no higher power is delivered. The extent to which performance improves depends on the type of goal. It makes a big difference whether the goal is a 40-kilometer time trial on the flat or a 13.8-kilometer Alpine col like the Alpe d’Huez. The level, weight and stature of the cyclist are also decisive. A better cyclist, for example, cycles more power and simply benefits more from aerodynamic improvements, because the air resistance increases quadratically at a higher speed. Therefore, we cannot avoid cutting some corners and assume an average cyclist with an average stature and condition. With that cyclist we cycle in beautiful windless conditions with 20 degrees at sea level.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tNow, our cyclist barely needs an hour for the time trial and it takes just over an hour to climb the Alpe d’Huez.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOf course, we’d also like to see the marginal gains (improvements) put in perspective with costs per each intervention.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tIn the table above, it is mainly the aerodynamic wheels that make a significant difference in time trialing. The other minimal differences are, of course, also very interesting for a top cyclist in the professional peloton. In addition, it is striking that aerodynamic improvements do not pay off uphill, at least not for the amateur. An aerodynamically closed helmet also causes heat build-up and therefore most likely has a negative effect compared to the negligible positive aerodynamic effect. When the speeds are higher uphill, the proportions within the pro peloton are slightly different, but there too, lightweight, and ventilating material is chosen for a mountain stage.\n\t\n\t\t\tMarginal gains add up to a big difference.\nTreating all marginal gains separately is, incidentally, not entirely fair. The idea of ​​marginal gains is precisely that they add up to a big difference. If we were to optimize this for all the improvements in the table, we would arrive at 500 grams of extra weight, a CdA of 0.248, a rolling resistance of 0.003 and a drive train efficiency of 97%. In doing aerodynamic tests on the track or in the wind tunnel, these are very realistic gains that can be made. In the climbing position we only go for the aero socks for the morale in terms of aerodynamics and especially for the lighter bike in combination with the lower rolling resistance and drive train.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tIf you add everything together, you can see quite a significant improvement. The question is whether it is worth the cost. This package will cost you a whopping € 2,493 per percent improvement for the time trial set-up and € 4,515 per percent for the climbing package. Although all these factors can contribute to a certain extent of performance improvement, training and nutrition remain the most important factors for progress on the bike. It is therefore important to prioritize consistent training, a balanced diet, and the right nutritional strategies for optimal results. As a satisfied EnduroCo user recently told us: “In 9 months my FTP has increased from 153 Watts to 340 Watts”. So, to become more than twice as good for only € 90 euros seems to be a great bang for your buck.\n\t\n\t\t\tImprove your FTP\nTo round up, let’s assume a very realistic scenario. If our cyclist improves his FTP with EnduroCo by 15% in half a year, then his FTP is not 280 Watt but 322 Watt. What does that mean in the original set-up for the time trial and climb times?\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tPhysiological improvements vs Marginal gains\nThese physiological improvements easily beat the marginal gains. Interestingly, this difference is much greater in the mountains than on the time trial bike. Converted to costs, we are talking about only € 11.30 per percent improvement in the time trial and just even € 4.60 on the Alpe d’Huez. The conclusion can therefore be guessed: nutrition and training provide a much greater improvement, which also means that a combination of the two is a great option!"

    "content": "Cycling your first 100 kilometres is obviously a milestone that requires quite a bit of training. Of course, you also need to be able to enjoy it a bit and not completely destroy yourself because you didn’t prepare properly. To get this done, here are our most important tips.\n\t\n\t\t\tSlowly build up the duration of training sessions\nIt is important for every cyclist to slowly build up the duration of training sessions. Not only for the novice cyclist, but also for the experienced cyclist who starts again after several weeks of inactivity. Therefore, start with 45 to 60 minutes per workout and make the longest workout per week about 10% longer. If you experience complaints on the bikes or you feel far too tired when coming home, then stay at the current training duration for an extra week.\nIf you want to do more, train more frequent but not longer. It is much more effective to train more often and more intensively, even if your goal is to ride longer. This may sound counterintuitive, but research shows that recreational cyclists can improve their endurance fitness just as well with 2-3 hours of high-intensity training (HIT) per week as with 10-12 hours of easy endurance training.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tInterval training\nIt is therefore recommended to start interval training early on. EnduroCo can of course help you with this. In the first 3 to 4 training sessions, keep the intensity low. It’s mainly about gaining confidence on the bike and comfort in the saddle. In addition, it is smart to do high-intensity intervals at least once a week. As mentioned above, you should then not experience any complaints on the bike, e.g. to your seat or knees. In addition, you should have confidence in steering and cycling at higher speeds. If this is not yet the case, you might consider having a bikefitting carried out first.\nThis way, the longest endurance training after a 12-week period is almost 3 hours. At an average of 25km/h, it will take you 4 hours to do your first 100km. However these 12 weeks should be enough to complete your first 100km, provided you eat and drink well during your ride. Besides one longer ride per week, you’ll do 1 to 3 shorter training sessions with some more intervals. Although you obviously want to build confidence in outdoor cycling, you can also do these kinds of rides indoors on Zwift, for example. Preferably, you train in a polarised way. That means alternating easy endurance training with high-intensity training.. Again, it is advisable to follow a training plan in EnduroCo and let EnduroCo do it’s magic.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tTraining with carbohydrates\nDrinking well means drinking at least one 500ml sports drink every hour. It’s best to choose an isotonic beverage with 20 to 35 grams of carbohydrates. Supplement this number of carbohydrates to 60 to 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour with food. More is better, but consuming 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour is quite difficult and you will have to train the gut for this. Therefore, if for your first 100 kilometres you get no further than 40 to 50 grams per hour, there’s really no shame in that.\nFor your first 100 kilometres, you can of course go out with a group. That often means, you can complete the distance much faster. You are also usually shorter on the bike, because you can share the head turns. However, your first 100 kilometres might be about being “self-supporting”. That means you should have your own food and drink strategy figured out and be able to change an inner tube yourself. So you should not forget to master this in the first 12 weeks of your training build-up.\nGood luck!"

    "content": "The dos and don’ts for Rebound\nRebound tip 1\nMake sure you’ve tested all your gear before you use it on D-day. Don’t start with brand-new tires, chains, cassettes or whatever, but make sure you’ve done at least an one hour (easy) spin the day before, so you know you can rely on it. The same goes for nutrition, hydration or even stuff like bibs, water bottles or camel bags. We understand it’s pretty daddy cool to show up in or with some brand-new shining gear, but it’s more important to get at that finish line.\nRebound tip 2\nBe well rested. If you follow a training plan, which we hope you do on EnduroCo, follow the set taper period. Your form on the day is the outcome of condition minus fatigue. This taper will also ensure your carbohydrate storages in the liver and muscles are completely full, if of course you keep eating properly, with some extra carbs in run-up for Rebound.\nRebound tip 3\nKeep your stops to a minimum. Actually, one of the rules of Rebound is to keep the rest stops to a maximum of 2, but an extra advice is to make those stops not too long. Eating and drinking can be easily done on the bike instead of off the bike. Some would argue this also goes for peeing, but we leave that up to you. If, for example, you peddle for 10 minutes at 15 km/h while eating, you still tick 2,5 km. If someone needs to close that gap while you speed up to 30 km/h he or she needs to ride half an hour at 35 km/h and that’s a big effort.\nRebound tip 4\nThis event might come across as a cycling event, while it’s actually an eating contest. The most limiting factor in your performance will likely be the amount of carbs you have left in your tank. You can empty the complete storage of approximately 600 grams within 60-90 minute of near threshold work and you can only replenish this with about 90 grams an hour. For this you need to eat a lot and you need to train this. Especially for really long rides this is the key in completing your challenge. The aim here is to start eating right from the get go preferably glucose and fructose in a 2:1 ratio."

Both the cyclist and the person driving the moped should be experienced in this part. In doing so, choose a quiet environment to complete the training sessions.\n2) The exhaust fumes from a moped contain particulate matter. Not ideal for an athlete’s lungs. So make sure the moped has a proper exhaust to minimize the inhalation of particulate matter.\n3) Train at a high intensity and in intervals. The goal is to increase power at your FTP. By training in intervals and recovering from them in between, you will be able to push the speed even higher.\n4) Play with the motor. A motor is an ideal opponent since, provided there is enough fuel, it will always win from you. This allows you to simulate race situations."

Whether you are a amateur cyclist or simply interested in the sport, there is always something to discover and learn about the history and background of cycling. A great way to increase your knowledge of the world of cycling is by reading the best books on cycling.\nBut where do you start looking? There are thousands of books written about cycling, ranging from autobiographies of famous cyclists to historical analyses of the sport (based on scientific research and/or experience) and travel reports of famous cycling races. Therefore, it can be a challenge to find the right book that matches your interest and level.\nHow and where to find books about cycling\nA good place to start is online bookstores. Major retailers like Amazon offer a wide range of cycling books, making it easy to search for authors, titles, and subjects. Smaller specialized bookstores, such as De Muur and Cyclostyle, also offer an extensive range of cycling books. Moreover, these bookstores can often recommend books based on your interest and level.\nAnother source of cycling books are libraries. Many libraries have a selection of books about cycling in their collection, and as a library member, you can borrow these books for free. Additionally, you can often search for books on specific topics on the library’s website and then reserve them.\nFinally, there is the option to buy second-hand books. On websites like Thriftbooks, BookFinder.com and wob.com, you can often find cycling books at a lower price than the original retail price. The downside is that you do not always have the guarantee that the book is in good condition, but if you are willing to take that risk, it is certainly an option to consider.\nBeter Worden Podcast book tips\nHere are some book recommendations from Jim van den Berg (perfomance scientist and trainer of multiple World Tour riders) and former pro cyclist Laurens ten Dam, as discussed in episode 66 of the Beter Worden Podcast (Dutch only), where they talked about their favorite books on cycling:\nBook tips Jim van den Berg:\n\nHow Bad Do You Want It?: Mastering the Psychology of Mind Over Muscle, Matt Fitzgerald.\nDraft Animals, Phil Gaimon.\nCycling science, Stephen S.

    "content": "In the EnduroCo Cycling app, you can see the eFTP at your profile in the training statistics overview. This is your estimated FTP. We have noticed that this feature is really appreciated by our users and checked regularly. Therefore, we’d like to tell you a little more about it and how to use it properly within your training plan.\nWhat exactly is eFTP?\nThe name says it all, it is an estimate, a calculation of your FTP based on your training data. In itself, it is not a new concept. In software like WKO+ (the scientific desktop version of Trainingpeaks) or Trainerroad, this metric also exists. The way it is calculated in EnduroCo is different (better of course) and may therefore differ from your eFTP on other platforms. Even if the data used as input is exactly the same.\nHow is the eFTP calculated\nThe basis of the calculation is your actual FTP. The more accurate and up-to-date you have tested this, the more accurate your eFTP will be calculated. The most accurate method to measure your FTP is an exercise test with lactate measurement in a sports laboratory. However, a 20-minute test is also a great alternative. A 60-minute test or time trial should match your FTP perfectly, but you need to be very experienced to pace this properly. With a 12-minute test – or a so-called ‘ramp test’ – you’re done quickly and the repeatability is greater, but unfortunately determining your FTP becomes quite inaccurate. To properly keep your zones accurate, EnduroCo schedules a 20-minute FTP test every 3 months.\nSo the starting point of your eFTP is an FTP that is accurate and current, preferably not older than 3 months. Then, based on the power data you provide, it detects if there are any intervals that warrant increasing your FTP. That’s not all, because not every workout is a test or contains all-out efforts. This is why EnduroCo also models how a ‘regular’ workout affects your FTP. This uses all your available training data in addition to your power data.\nAn FTP test every 3 months\nIt is important to stress that eFTP is a calculation. It does not take into account whether you have eaten or slept badly, for example. In practice, your FTP is not the same every day. Yet you don’t have to adjust your FTP every day to match the shape of the day. So you don’t have to change your FTP based on your eFTP either. In fact, in training, you try to do your intervals within certain ranges based on your FTP. On a good day, this will be in the higher part of the targeted zone than on a bad day.\nTherefore, you can confidently do a FTP test and adjust your FTP every 3 months. If after 1.5 or 2 months you already have a much higher eFTP than your entered FTP, e.g. a deviation of more than 15%, you might consider doing a 20-minute test a bit earlier. This might be the case when you have started to train much more from an inactive lifestyle. Then you make a lot of progression in the first few weeks. Under normal training conditions, testing every 3 months is more than enough.\nGarbage in is garbage out\nIf you don’t have a power meter or don’t know what your FTP is, EnduroCo will still estimate your FTP and eFTP based on your training data and profile settings. In that case, bear in mind that the accuracy of your eFTP is many times less without a properly measured FTP as a starting point. If EnduroCo has little training data to analyze, the calculation of your eFTP’s development is also much less accurate.\nAll in all, we are very proud of the eFTP calculation in EnduroCo. With good input, we found after much testing that our method is very accurate. If the data used in the calculation is of lower quality, the calculated value will be less accurate. So when reading your eFTP, always take into account whether it is based on an FTP that is accurate and up-to-date and how rich the training data you provide is."

    "content": "Cycling is not technically a very complicated sport. In essence, cycling is one of the few truly cyclical sports out there, by which is actually meant that it involves repetition of movement. The pedalstroke consists of two phases; a downward and an upward phase. Because you are stuck to the pedals on the bike, it is possible to add power  during both phases, which can be converted into speed. However, this addition of power throughout the pedalstroke does not mean that it is also the most efficient way of cycling.\nWorking against yourself\nIn fact, it could be that you are working against yourself. Your upward leg works against the downward leg which is currently delivering power. As a result, this leg actually has to pedal even harder to keep the externally delivered power the same. Obviously not very convenient which will further increase oxygen intake as the total power to be delivered increases further. As a result, fatigue will occur faster which obviously decrease the performance.\nTo prevent this obstruction, there are many sensible but, above all, many nonsensical techniques described on the internet. One technique that often comes up is deliberately pulling or sometimes discharging the pedals in the uphill phase. Focusing on this during training should improve pedalling efficiency.\nPush and pull?\nHowever, recent research shows that cyclists who consciously pull the pedals upwards consume relatively much more oxygen to deliver the total amount of power (Schücker et al, 2016). So the widely preached ‘pushing and pulling’ on the pedals turns out to be nonsense. The reason for this is actually quite simple too. The feedback from our nerve system is a lot faster and smarter than our consciousness. The muscles in your left leg are much sooner aware of what your right leg is doing, before your consciousness is aware of it. The body automatically looks for the most efficient way to move forward, saving fuel that can come in handy later. Evolutionarily, of course, this is mostly very convenient and logical. So by consciously imposing a different coordination pattern on yourself, you actually disrupt a process that normally runs perfectly automatically.\nTo improve pedalling efficiency or not?\nDefinitely yes, just not by interfering with this automatic process. It starts with proper bike tuning. Indeed, within the adjustment, the body itself looks for the most efficient method. If the saddle is too high, the plates wrongly adjusted and the handlebars too deep, pedalling efficiency will never be optimal. So start with a good bikefitting, where you adjust the bike to the body and not the other way around. Think of a bike fitting as a range you have to fall within. A well-trained body should not be bothered by a millimetre difference in saddle height.\nTips to improve pedalstroke efficiency\n\nTrain a lot of miles, basically the human body is not meant to be on a bike. However, the body is incredibly adaptive (read; good at adapting to changing situations). By cycling lots of kilometres, your body will get used to the unnatural pedalling motion and eventually become a lot more efficient. No wonder pros score highest on pedal stroke efficiency!\nTrain at low cadence, for example by doing seated power blocks at low cadence. Because the movement speed is a lot slower, the body can get used to the pedal cycle better. Especially if you make sure the intensity of these blocks is high enough, your body will work on becoming more efficient so that no energy is wasted.\nTrain at high cadence, at first it won’t feel comfortable but eventually the body gets used to doing blocks at high cadence. You will start to bounce less in the saddle. When you return to your old, voluntarily chosen cadence, you will find that it feels a lot easier.\nTrain on different bikes in different disciplines. While it used to be thought that mastering something mainly required endless repetition, nowadays the thinking is that it is precisely by changing conditions regularly that the learning process is accelerated. So training on a fixed gear, the mtb or occasionally grabbing the time trial bike is wise. In this light, the same crank length on every bike may also not be that effective at all.\nStrength training in the gym, cyclists who do strength training in the gym in addition to a lot of cycling develop a proven more efficient pedalling movement compared to cyclists who cycle alone. This is thought to be because strength training increases neural adaptations such as improved control of the leg muscles (Loveless et al, 2005). Do prefer to work with free weights and, of course, proper execution.\nImproving your endurance capacity, as fatigue decreases control considerably. As a result, you also lose efficiency (Pasfield and Doust, 2000).\n\nSo don’t let special pedalling techniques that you have to master fool you. In the end, it is mainly a matter of sitting properly on your bike and regularly taking your body out of its comfort zone by training on varying pedalling frequencies.\nLiterature;\n\nLoveless, DJ.

You’ll ride 38 kilometers over the beach, through the dunes, over challenging obstacles and short & steep climbs.

One thing is for sure: this beach race is the most epic race you will ride!\nBeachracing is a discipline that is only practised in winter and is a good way for mountainbikers and road cyclists to have competitive incentives even in the cold months. The tyres on the beach bike have less tread than a mountain bike tyre, in order to ride on beach as hard as possible. After all, that’s where 90% of the racing takes place. The rest often consists of technical aspects like stair climbing or other challenging obstacles.\nThe fastest climber during a beachrace?\nAre you an explosive puncher?

The short but steep climb makes the difference in the race and can be compared to the famous Cauberg in terms of gradient. The fastest climbers in the race and among the cyclosportives will win a hotel package from Strandhotel Het Hoge Duin. Who knows, you might surprise one of the (former) pros in this climbing classification.\nOn the way back to the finish after 27 km there is a spectacular exit from the beach at Castricum aan Zee. Those who are not in the leading group on their return to the beach towards Castricum aan Zee, or have ridden too much in the red on the climb, can put the distinctive trophy out of their minds. The loose sand at the beach entrance, the steep climb, the steps to descend and the obstacles in the descent back to the beach make this perhaps the most spectacular part of the GP Groot Egmond-Pier-Egmond.\nOn the podium after a beachrace\nSebastian Langeveld, Timothy Dupont, Lars Boom and Ivar Slik. Just a few of the riders who have been on the podium (several times) during the GP Groot Egmond-Pier-Egmond beachrace. How cool that you can be at the start on the same day as the 9fromer) pro’s. The final ceremony will be held once everyone has crossed the finish line, in Sporthal de Watertoren.\nYou can take part in this wonderful Le Champion event individually or as a business team participant. Get together with colleagues and/or friends in training and experience the adventure together. Each participant will be able to celebrate the achievement in the Sporthal de Watertoren afterwards. As a business participant, you will have extra benefits and access to the business tent.\nEverything is taken care of: tight organisation, closed course, a well-deserved medal and opportunities to hose down your bike. Will you take on the epic challenge?"

    "content": "A question that comes up frequently is what power or heart rate you should focus on in your intervals with the EnduroCo Cycling workouts. For example, should you look at the heart rate or power that jumps every second or at the average over the entire interval. And is that different for very long intervals or over your entire workout? For example, how do you handle turns or hills in your interval? Should you compensate for the moments when didn’t pedal? Again cycling turns out not to be as easy as it seems.\nFirst, there is a big difference in training for heart rate and power. With power, you can focus on target power from the very first seconds. Of course, you may have a bad day or the conditions are not optimal, but in principle it should just be doable. After all, the heart rates and power outputs associated with the intervals are tailored to your abilities. With heart rate, however, you have to trust your instincts much more. Your heart rate rises slowly to the target heart rate and if you trained hard the day before or get dehydrated at the end of your workout, the heart rate response is very difficult to interpret. We have written an extensive article about comparing your power and heart rate before.\nMatching the route to your workout\nWhat we mainly want to talk about now is what you should do if, for example, you have to ride 250 watts for 10 minutes, but encounter 4 turns or a small hill with downhill. First of all, you try to avoid this of course and match the route to your workout. It is much easier to keep your power output constant with unchanging conditions. So preferably aim your intervals at long stretches straight road on the flat or with an even gradient, as explained in the ‘Beter Worden Podcast‘ episode 52.\nTarget power or heart rate\nNow that doesn’t always work out and in that case do not try to average the target power or heart rate. After all, that would mean (too) hard accelerations after every turn or all out on a climb with the goal of compensating for the moments you don’t pedal. Of course, you try to minimize those moments, but if you try to compensate this then you are targeting (partially) another energy system. That, of course, is not the purpose of structured intervals.\nPerhaps more importantly, and in any case a situation that occurs regularly, is when a long and easy endurance training is planned within the endurance. Of course, you then never ride exactly the target power, but you try to stay within the targeted zone with a certain bandwidth. In addition, you may well sprint or push yourself on a short climb, but it is not the intention to ride much higher power numbers on a climb of 10 minutes or longer to compensate for the descent.\nHeadwind or tailwind\nIt also happens regularly that the route is cridden with a headwind in the first half and a tailwind for the second half. If you don’t pay attention, the first half you ride at 250 watts and the second half at 150 watts. This is then a substantially different effort than a constant 200 Watts, while the average power is the same.\nBased on heart rate, you may find this difference impossible to notice at all. This is because the second half brings with some fatigue and thus the heart rate is automatically a bit higher for the same power output. In addition, a headwind often results in a somewhat higher cadence and thus a less efficient pedaling and therefore also a higher heart rate. So it may very well be that the 250 Watt with the head wind against in the first half results in the same heart rate as the 150 Watt with tailwind.\nIn the end, it’s is best to adjust the route to the training. Especially with very strong winds, you can try to ride a bit more sheltered or meander a bit more instead of the “good-old” first half head wind and then tailwind. Very crazy idea of course, but just give it a try."

    "content": "In autumn and winter, it becomes less pleasant for some to enjoy cycling outside. That is why it is very handy if you can train indoors at home. Just bought a new Tacx or Wahoo but no idea where to start with indoor training and looking for tips & tricks? To get you started, we have a few tips for you. This will make it easier to start indoor training on the Tacx or Wahoo smarttrainer.\nThe great thing about training at home is that you can completely focus on the training itself and are not distracted by other road users, traffic lights or the weather. This allows you to keep a close eye on exactly what your training is doing to you. But is it enough to sit down and enjoy a bit of cycling? Here are our tips for a successful start to home training!\nStart with indoor training\n\nMake sure you have a goal. Aimless indoor training is not a good idea, whether you ride in a virtual world or not. If you are already more experienced, you probably know exactly how to keep that one ambitious goal in mind that makes training useful and fun for yourself. If you are a true beginner, contact an expert or load up on a (EnduroCo) indoor workout that gives the right build-up for you. Selecting the right training goal within the EnduroCo Cycling cycling app will create the most efficient training schedule for you.\nDo an performance test before you start. With the outcome of an performance test, you will know exactly where your areas of improvement lie and where you are already strong. If you want to test as accurately as possible, it is best to choose an exercise test with longer blocks (of about six minutes). That way, at the end of the day, you will have a test in your hands that allows you to make good steps towards your final goal. Enter the results of your FTP and your heart rate reference point in your personal profile in the EnduroCo app and you will train in the right zones at all times.\nNo performance test? Do a test within the EnduroCo app. This will give you an indication of your power and heart rate at the threshold. The EnduroCo app detects the right values and adds them to your training plan. This way, you are always ‘on track’ for achieving your goals.\n\nZwift the race of your life\nZwift is an indoor training application where you can both train and ride Zwift races in a virtual world. With or without opponents. The races are calculated on Watt/kg. In other words, your FTP divided by your body weight. This way, the races remain as fair as possible and you ride against equal riders in the various level groups. There are many different races available, at multiple times of the day. From small flat rounds, to longer distances with more hills or steep clminbings in them, to time trials. The riders you virtually encounter come from all over the world. You will be amazed at the size of the pelotons.\nIndoor training within Zwift\nIndoor training within Zwift’s virtual world is also a good option. Zwift offers many different workouts, for the various different training goals. You can also up load your EnduroCo workout (via a zwo.file or link with TrainingPeaks). You have the option to ride the workout with or without ERG mode. ERG mode is a mode that ensures you have constant pressure on your pedals, so you can perform your workout perfectly as long as you keep pressure on the pedals. If your cadence drops, the smarttrainer will adjust the resistance. In this way, you continue to deliver the workload required for the desired result at all times. The disadvantage is that if your cadence drops too low, it gets to heavy that you can no longer rotate the pedals normally. Find the right balance and training method for yourself!"

    "content": "A good polarized training plan contains a combination of different types of workouts and will include workouts around the turnover point and interval workouts in addition to gentle endurance training. We call this the 80/20 rule. In addition to consistency, varying your training in both duration, intensity and also overall volume is an important component of “getting better” through polarized training. A schedule where you always do the same thing won’t make you better after about eight weeks. This is because the body has then become accustomed to the training stimulus and no longer improves because of it.\nHowever, in recent years there has been a clear trend in intensity distribution, with top endurance athletes training very hard or very quietly. This 80/20 distribution in the training plan – with almost no training in the gray area in between – is also called polarized training.\n80/20 rule for polarized training\nThe obvious thing to do is train on your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), the power a rider can deliver for an hour. Funnily enough, this does not appear to be the most effective way to train. When looking at how high-level athletes trained, it turns out that these athletes have a particular intensity distribution. Research shows roughly a distribution of 80 percent gentle workouts (endurance training) and 20 percent hard workouts (interval) is a distribution that is very common.\nTraining around the FTP is thus virtually avoided. The reason is that training around the tipping point mainly causes fatigue, while the stimulus is not strong enough to improve the body of well-trained endurance athletes. By doing the low-intensity workouts more slowly, by the time interval training is scheduled, you will be equipped enough to go to the limit. Interestingly, this typical 80-20 distribution has been found in cyclists as well as other endurance athletes such as runners, swimmers, rowers and cross-country skiers.\nSo it seems that a polarized way of training is more effective than an 80/20 training plane that involved a lot of training around the tipping point. A training distribution where 80 percent of the time is gentle and 20 percent of the time is very heavy seems to provide the right training adaptations while also leaving enough room for recovery.\nExercise thresholds\nThe problem with this method of training, however, is that each rider has a different effort threshold. Thus, each workout can be interpreted differently. So how do you determine what is a “hard” workout and what is a “gentle” one? A 3 zone model is often used where the boundaries of these zones are determined by the aerobic and anaerobic threshold (this is determined during an exercise test). Everything below the aerobic threshold is characterized as quiet (zone 1), workouts between the aerobic and anaerobic threshold as workouts around the tipping point (zone 2), above the anaerobic threshold the heavy interval workouts take place (zone 3).\nBoth thresholds can be determined with an exercise test, which measures lactate production. The higher the intensity, the greater the load on the body becomes and the more lactate is produced. Whereas initially there is primarily an increase in the aerobic system, later on more and more anaerobic energy will also be released. The disadvantage of this, however, is that acidification takes place. Two thresholds can be distinguished here: the aerobic threshold and the anaerobic threshold.\naerobic threshold\nThe aerobic threshold is the first point at which the body starts producing substantially more lactate. At this point, absolutely fat burning is maximal. This point is usually around 2 mmol of lactate and can only be determined during an exercise test. The higher the aerobic threshold, the better your endurance training is.\nanaerobic threshold\nThe anaerobic threshold, also called the tipping point, is the last point at which the lactate concentration is stable and balanced. If you start cycling at a power level above the anaerobic threshold, more and more lactate will be produced and your muscles will acidify. This causes you to have to stop the effort. The anaerobic threshold has a strong correlation with the FTP.\nPolarized training plan\nAfter determining both thresholds, it is important to start working on your fitness with a polarized training plan. Here it is important to keep the intensity during quiet training sessions below the aerobic threshold. This will keep you fresh enough to do vigorous interval training 1-2 times a week. These interval training sessions create adaptations (adjustments in the body) that are not achieved with endurance training. Both of these types of workouts are best performed with a power meter, which makes it possible to control the intensity of the workout very precisely.\nDuring endurance training, it is important not to cycle too hard and to keep the power below the power at the aerobic threshold. During interval training, on the contrary, the intensity should be above the anaerobic threshold."

    "content": "With an example of a core stability training scheme.\nYou can’t fire a cannon from a canoe. This is the best way to describe why core stability is so important for a cyclist. In this article we briefly explain why every cyclist should include core stability training in his daily routine and what exercises are the most useful.\nCore stability are all the muscles of the back, abdomen, buttocks and hip that provide a stable posture. These muscles are used daily to a greater or lesser extent. On the bike you need them to effectively transfer the power of your legs to the pedals. A better trained core ensures that the posture remains stable during the pedaling movement so that all the power is transferred to the pedal stroke as effectively as possible. Especially at high pedaling frequencies, a better trained core ensures that you do not bounce off the saddle and at very low pedaling frequencies (and a high torque), for example when toiling uphill, it ensures that all power flows to the pedal. You will notice that you need these muscles if you cycle uphill a lot and your lower back starts to ache. The same can happen during long stretches against the wind. If your goal is to climb a mountain, it makes sense to give these muscles extra attention when training off the bike.\n5 rules for a good core stability routine.\nThe fact that most cyclists are not used to core stability training often lies in the lack of knowledge of what exactly they can do. In addition, many routines are quite too long and you’d rather spend that time on the bike. Therefore below please find our 5 rules for a good core stability routine.\n\nWork on your core stability at least 3 times a week. Less is too little while more is better.\nDo the same exercises as much as possible. Keep it simple, this way you ensure that you actually do it. Bring in some new exercises only after 8 weeks when you feel the need for a new set.\nAlways do it at the same time. For example, right out of bed or after you get out of the shower, before bed. It doesn’t really matter, but work on that routine.\nA total set of exercises including rest, should not last more than 5 to 8 minutes. Longer is not necessary and only makes it harder to stick to the routine.\nTrain back, abdomen, buttocks and hip in equal measure. Be especially careful not to overwork those abs because you want to have that hot beach body. If the balance is missing, it can actually lead to additional pain in your back or elsewhere.\n\nOur top-5 core exercises for cyclists.\nWith the above tips in mind, here are 5 exercises suitable to any cyclist. Ideally, you should do all the exercises for 40 seconds. If that is not possible, start with 20 seconds and slowly build up to 40 seconds. If it is too easy for you, do the exercises for a maximum of 60 seconds. Between the exercises you keep 5 seconds rest. A yoga mat is nice but not really necessary, a carpet works fine as well.\n\nThe superman plank.\n\nPut both your hands and knees on the floor, then simultaneously extend your left arm and right leg and hold this position with slight movements for 40 seconds. Then it’s the turn of the right arm and left leg.\n\nThe bicycle crunch\n\nIt sounds more complicated than it is and there are countless versions, but while cycling in the air you raise your upper body about 10 centimeters off the ground. In doing so, you can try to use your hands under your head to touch your knee with your elbows, but this is not a must. As long as you start to feel the abdominal muscles you’re OK. This also trains your hips through the cycling movement.\n\nThe side plank\n\nLie on one elbow and hold your body in the air like a plank. The oblique abdominal muscles in particular will get a good workout. You can make this exercise extra heavy by moving your upper leg 10 to 20 centimeters up and down, or by dipping the hips to the floor.\n\nThe bridge with leg raises\n\nLie on your back, then lift your buttocks off the ground and bring your knees to a 90-degree angle. Tighten the buttocks and abdomen so that your knees, hips, and shoulders are in a straight line. Then alternate extending the left and right leg all the way out.\n\nKnee-to-elbow plank\n\nBring yourself in the plank position but with arms extended and hands on the floor. Keep the rest of the body stretched. Then alternately move the left knee to the right elbow and vice versa.\nIf this routine is still too difficult, make the duration of the exercises a little shorter. If you notice that you need more rest between the exercises, then also shorten the duration of the exercises, so that the total set does not take too long. Finally, do not forget to breathe. This may sound obvious but sometimes it is forgotten in the heat of the moment."

    "content": "Sprinting, accelerating, descending or time trialing are all very nice to do, but nothing beats cycling up a beautiful mountain pass. There is nothing more rewarding than toiling your way up all those altitude meters arriving on a mountain top or a famous col. Everyone who has ever ridden up a serious climb has also wondered: should I stand on the pedals or stay in the saddle? Usually this question is answered unconsciously as you get out of the saddle on a hunch to try and give some suffering muscle groups a little relief. But which is actually better and where and when should you get out of the saddle? In this article we address these questions.\nMore power and more muscle groups\nThe big difference between standing and seated climbing is in the bio-mechanics. When you stand on the pedals, literally all of your weight is in a straight line above the pedals. This allows you to use more muscles. In particular, your butt and calf muscles can now be recruited much more efficiently, while your quadriceps can also provide more power. In addition, your upper body, trunk and arm muscles can contribute to the forward cycling motion, which allows you to deliver more power overall.\nHigher air resistance when climbing standing\nBy standing on the pedals, the frontal surface increases considerably and thus the air resistance. Part of the extra power generated by standing is therefore immediately lost to the increased air resistance. However, climbing is usually done at low speeds, so getting out of the saddle does not create a lot of extra resistance.\nType-II muscle fibers\nSo by climbing while standing you can deliver more power, just like with sprinting while standing. However, this always comes at a cost in terms of higher overall energy consumption, so you will build up more muscle fatigue. Research shows that this higher energy does not go hand in hand with a higher oxygen uptake. This means that this extra power is mostly generated by anaerobic, type-II muscle fibers. As a result, more oxygen is not immediately required to deliver the higher power output. However, this anaerobic energy has a limited availability, so at some point you have to go back in the saddle to recover and work off the lactic acid build up during that anaerobic effort.\nEverybody who has ever done a long, mountainous cyclosportive ride will recognize this, as on the final climb you can only sustain climbing out of the saddle for a short while, if at all still. A study of high-level cyclists has found that they mainly climb out of the saddle to keep their speed as constant and as high as possible throughout a climb. On steep sections, these cyclists climbed standing for a short time and then on flatter sections they would go back in the saddle to recover.\nThe factors that determine when to stand\nWhen is it better to stand than to stay seated? This is actually a fairly complex interplay of several factors. First of all, speed is important. If the speed is high, the extra power gained by standing is compensated by the increased air resistance. Of course, that speed is largely dependent on the steepness of the climb, but also on how strong you are. Research shows that climbing standing is especially beneficial when your power output is close to or above your threshold (or FTP). However, this point at which it is better to stand is different for each individual. It depends, for example, on the distribution of muscle fibers. Someone with a lot of anaerobic, type-II muscle fibers can stand longer and more often than someone with more aerobic, type-I muscle fibers.\nFinally, body weight is also a very important factor. Because standing climbing involves putting all of one’s weight above the pedals, a heavier cyclist must also support a greater weight. A lighter cyclist can therefore stand more often and for longer, while very heavy cyclists enjoy very few benefits at all from getting out of the saddle.\nPractical tips\nFinally, three important tips to keep in mind before you start on that magic climb. Firstly, shift gears a little heavier when you stand. Because you engage more muscle groups when climbing out of the saddle, the coordination also becomes more complex. If the pedaling frequency is too high, the cycling movement will quickly become inefficient because you will be working against your coordination. Therefore, ideally ride with a cadence about 5 to 10 rpm lower than sitting down. Secondly, don’t sway the bike from left to right. This might look rather impressive, but it also increases rolling resistance. A slight swaying motion can help to improve the bio-mechanical transfer from your hip to your pedals, but don’t overdo it.\nThe last and perhaps most important tip is to not underestimate the intelligence of the human body. Your body can tell you when to stand and when not to stand. Try not to override your brain when it tells you something, but learn to listen to it."

    "content": "What many road cyclists who occasionally take the MTB or MTB riders who occasionally ride on the roadbike encounter is that the intensity of these training sessions is difficult to compare. So how can MTB and riding the roadbike be combined in one training schedule?\nFirst of all it is important to realize that a workout on the MTB is very different from an effort on the road bike. On the road bike, you mainly deliver power below your threshold with a constant pressure on the pedals and often somewhere between 80 and 100 rpm. As a result, the energy supply is for the most part aerobic and mainly the slow muscle fibers type that is dependent on oxygen and fat are used. In addition, the force per pedal rotation is more or less the same for every pedal stroke and power remain constant. There is therefore often enough time to compensate for delays in the rise and fall of the heart rate.\nOn the mountain bike, on the other hand, you make short fierce efforts or keep your legs (almost) completely still. It is often really on or off. These efforts, on the other hand, depend largely on the powerful fast muscle fibers and are short and anaerobic. So the powers is much more volatile and the heart rate that goes with it is always lagging. Therefore, the heart rate doesn’t tell well how hard the effort really is.\nMTB & interval workout\nIt is actually impossible to do structured interval training on the MTB. Even short micro intervals of 40 seconds are difficult to execute because it is important to keep the rest intervals the same each time. This does not mean that MTB training once a week is a good addition for a road cyclist with a goal on the road. For example, 2 times 20 minutes of a hard effort on a challenging MTB track is an excellent (unstructured) interval workout. For this road cyclist, it makes little sense to do more training on the MTB because the effort and thus the training effect differs too much from the goal.\nFor an MTB rider with a goal on the MTB the opposite applies. A good aerobic endurance training session once or twice a week helps to improve the basic condition, but too much endurance training on the road runs the risk of hampering the strength and explosiveness that the MTB rider needs. It should be noted that a goal such as the Transalp requires much more endurance training than a cross country race.\nMTB and roadbike with a powermeter\nWith a power meter on both an MTB and a road bike, the training sessions and the training load can be easily compared and can fit into the same training plan. Of course, this only applies when there is no discrepancy between the two power meters. It seems like a needless addition, but we see this go wrong more than once. In EnduroCo we assume normalized power to determine the training load. This takes into account the much higher volatility of power on the MTB. The fact that the effort on the MTB is often more intense is not reflected in the average power output, but is apparent from a much higher normalized power output.\nWorkout with heart rate & RPE\nIt often goes wrong when one trains with power on the road bike and with heart rate on the MTB. Especially on the MTB, heart rate says very little about the short, intense efforts. In this case, a power meter on the MTB and only heart rate on the road bike would even be a better combination. Because EnduroCo estimates the RPE based on normalized power or, in the absence of a power meter this figure on the MTB can sometimes deviate from the actual effort. The heart rate does not adequately tell whether short, intense efforts have been made.\nAs always, but even more so with MTB training based on heart rate, it is very important to let the feeling prevail about the intensity of the training. Especially when EnduroCo only has access to heart rate data, the RPE number will be weighed more heavily in the calculation of the training load than if power data is also available. As a result, with only heart rate data on the MTB, you can correct the training load by means of a higher RPE number. In this way, road training with power and MTB training with heart rate data can be combined into one training schedule. Of course you still need to make sure that you continue to do specific workouts in line with your goal."

    "content": "We are frequently asked how you can best build up the length of your long cycling rides. Fortunately you have your Join endurance training plan to show you how, but let us provide some background here.\nThe purpose of endurance training\nLong training rides are also called endurance training rides. The purpose of endurance training is mainly to cope well with the duration or distance. So it’s not about riding up a mountain faster, but mainly about being able to keep riding for longer. To be able to do that, you need a well-developed fat burning system. At low intensity your body is able to burn fat as long as there is enough oxygen. When the intensity increases, you will start burning more carbohydrates. That in itself is not a problem, however the supply of carbohydrates stored in your body is limited and so is the uptake capacity per hour through nutrition. So if you want to keep going for a long time, you need to train the fat burning system as the supply of body fat is far bigger than that of carbohydrates. Even people considered skinny have a fat supply that lasts for days.\nThe aerobic threshold\nYou can do this by making endurance training sessions progressively longer and by training with an intensity up to the aerobic threshold. The aerobic threshold is the point at which fat burning has reached its maximum share in the energy supply. If the intensity rises above the aerobic threshold, you will mainly burn more carbohydrates and the total amount of fat that you use will even decrease. The aerobic threshold lies below the threshold heart rate or FTP and usually lies at between 75 and 90 percent of your threshold. The better your endurance capabilities are, the more this percentage moves towards the upper bound.\nFirst increase the duration and then the intensity\nHow do you build up these endurance rides? It starts with looking at what duration you can currently handle well. To be able to cope well means that you can maintain the same low intensity pace over the entire effort while the heart rate does not increase or it does not feel heavier. If that is currently 3 hours then we start there. Depending on the length of the goal, we build this duration, where it is important to keep checking if it is still doable. As a rule of thumb, building up by 15 minutes per week is a good measure to start off with. In addition, it is advisable to add so-called tempo blocks at an intensity around the aerobic threshold to your training. This trains the maximum fat burning while the speed also increases. The aim is to first increase the duration at low intensity and then to add tempo blocks before increasing the duration again.\nDo not train for too long!\nIt is sensible to do a long endurance ride at least once a week. But how long is long enough? That depends, of course, on the goal ride that you are training for. If your goal event is not longer than 4-5 hours, then you can train for 6 hours for sure, but it would actually be sufficient to do a long ride of 4 hours every week. But even if you have a goal event planned that is much longer, it is still not advisable to make your weekly longer ride too long. Because the recovery from those really long rides takes so long that the next workouts in the following week are compromised. In other words, the fatigue is so high that the total training load in the next week falls too much. To test your gear, as a mental training or to test your nutrition strategy, you can ride the length of your goal race once, but don’t do it too often. If you are training for something really long, we advise to train quite long once a month, somewhere between 5 to 6 hours and do an endurance ride of not more than 4 to 4.5 hours in the other weeks. Using this approach, you should be well prepared for the length of your goal ride."

    "content": "Many of today’s cyclists are no longer just riding his or her bikes. More and more of them are regularly putting on a pair of running shoes, hitting the gym or the pool or joining a boot camp. But the cycling world was really turned upside down last spring when Roglic and Wout van Aert were running together on the flanks of the Teide volcano on the Canary Island of Tenerife during their altitude training camp. We already knew that Wout van Aert is not averse to a bit of running through the mud with his bike on his shoulder. But the fact that a general classification guy like Roglic regularly puts on his running shoes was news to many in the cycling world.\nThe question that immediately comes to mind for us mere mortals is: should we all start running now as well? Did they immediately send Robert Gesink and Steven Kruiswijk a pair of Nikes with carbon soles at Jumbo-Visma? In other words, what use is running to the cyclist? Before we dive into this matter, we need to separate a few scenarios. First, there is the cyclist who likes to run every now and then. He or she sees this more as support but the primary goals are still on the bike. A very healthy approach as far as we are concerned. Then there is the cyclist who sets himself a running goal. This means that cycling is still a part of the training regime, but that the cycling training could be subordinate to the running goal. Of course, there are also plenty of runners who cycle occasionally, but they probably aren’t reading this, so we’ll leave that group aside for convenience.\nRunning to ride your bike faster\n\nLet’s start with the cyclists who run to improve their cycling performance. Like in the case of Roglic. Is it a good idea? As with almost everything, it depends. But let’s be clear: running is not as disastrous for cyclists as is often suggested. Firstly, running largely uses the same muscle groups as cycling. However, the coordination (the relationship between strength and length) is completely different and an experienced cyclist will therefore benefit only a little from running as far as muscle build is concerned.\nNevertheless, running does contribute to the cycling condition through muscle adaptations. In addition, running trains the heart-lung system and this is also needed for cycling. Because running is always a weight-bearing activity, while cycling is that only uphill, so the intensity of running is quickly much higher than riding a bicycle. In other words, with running you can train the heart-lung system in a short time at a high intensity – and thus very effectively and efficiently. Actually, this is much more effective with running than with riding a road bike, unless you live at the foot of the Alpe d’Huez.\n\n\nThe eccentric impact of running\n\nYou can therefore train the heart-lung system very efficiently with running and largely use the same muscles. Ideal! The only problem is that with running, you don’t only use these muscles concentrically, but also eccentrically, which is something a cyclist is not used to. In the cycling movement, when you contract the muscles they shorten at the same time (concentric muscle movement). with running, when you use the muscles they are lengthened when you hit the ground. This is precisely the movement that causes muscle pain and makes it difficult to do a lot of running training volume. Of course, there are plenty of runners who run as much as seventy kilometers a week, but in general, an experienced cyclist can train many more hours on the bike than an experienced runner can run on the road.\n\n\nRunning is always weight-bearing\nSo with running, you are constantly supporting your own body weight. This impact not only has repercussions on your muscles but also on your tendons, joints and even on your bones. That’s why, as a beginner, you have to build up the load very slowly and, as a beginner who cycles, you have to be very, very careful. Your cycling condition is often at such a level that you could easily run ten kilometers at a brisk pace. The muscles, tendons and joints, however, can not handle this at all if you have not run regularly for a long time, so not unusually after a few running training sessions, injuries start to appear and the running shoes disappear back into the closet. A novice runner with a good physical condition should really start with a few minutes of running alternated with a minute of walking in the first few weeks of training and be careful not to immediately start running for ten or twenty minutes straight.\nRunning as a medicine\n\n\nThere is a positive aspect to the impact load. Because cycling is not a weight-bearing activity, the skeletal system is spared. Especially when you get older, when you cycle a lot and are a woman, merely cycling can have a negative effect on bone density. So-called osteoporosis is a particular danger for this high-risk group and running is actually the medicine to counteract it. Based on time considerations or other positive effects, the cyclist can very well add running training every now and then. But will it make you cycle faster?\nThat is actually very questionable. Ultimately, based on your level, you can handle a certain training load per day, week or month. In addition, not everyone has as much time to train as Roglic. Let alone as much time to rest. If you already do decent training volumes and intensities on your bike, you can’t just add running training on top of the cycling. If your name is not Roglic, you, quite literally, run the risk of doing too much. In addition, you may only be able to train a limited amount of time per week and then – depending on your goals and level – it is very questionable whether running training will add anything. One of the most important laws in training physiology is to train specifically. Train precisely what you want to get better at to achieve the greatest effect.\n\nCyclists with a running goal\n\n\nA word about the cyclists who, for whatever reason, have set a running goal. Firstly, the advice is to build up your workouts very slowly. And secondly, build out your workouts very slowly as well. It is precisely the running injuries among cyclists that have given rise to the persistent idea that running is inherently bad for cyclists. Because of this very slow build up, but also if you are already trained in running, you will notice that when you only run, the total training volume is lower than what you are used to on a bike. This is why longer endurance training on the bike is an ideal addition. So for this cycling runner, the combination with cycling is actually very easy.\nPractical tips\nFinally, a number of practical tips. As mentioned above, it is especially important for a trained cyclist to start running very slowly. In addition, in terms of technique, running is way more difficult than it looks. Therefore, especially in the beginning, do not run on an uneven surface, get advice on shoes that fit your physique and consider taking some lessons. This will reduce the impact load to a large extent and will significantly reduce the risk of injuries. And if it still does not work, remember that you can win the Tour de France without running training."

    "content": "Cycling is a sport that most people practice mostly in summer. In the Tour de France the pro cyclists get on their bikes every day even when the temperatures go through the roof, although there is now a heat protocol to protect the cyclists. Unlike football, riding a bike creates wind that provides the necessary cooling. Of course you sweat a lot and you have to drink more, but otherwise it’s eminently doable. Yet you must be careful at high temperatures as the impact of heat on your body should not be underestimated.\nProducing heat with cycling in de heat\nOnce on the bike, the body has to work to move you forward. Only a small part of the energy in this process can be used to put pressure on the pedals, about 20 percent. The remaining 80 percent is not lost but is converted into heat. If the body would do nothing with this heat, the body temperature would continue to rise and vital organs would no longer be able to function. This heat must therefore be gotten rid of.\nDistribution of heat\nFortunately, your body can cool down. This can technically be done in three ways, i.e. through conduction, radiation and convection. Conduction would be by touching a cold object, radiation is simply like the release of heat as the sun does, and convection is heat given off to flowing air or water. Sweating where you evaporate water to flowing air falls into the latter category and is by far the most effective way to release the body heat.\nThe problem with sweating\nBut a nasty side effect of sweating is that the body loses an enormous amount of fluid that is essential to keep other processes, such as muscle contraction, going. With too much fluid loss and too little fluid intake, dehydration is the result. In warm conditions and with intensive exercise, the body can lose two liters of fluid per hour. When you lose 2% of body weight in moisture, performance decreases noticeably and at 5%, performance can deteriorate by even 30%. In the absence of wind, for example uphill and in high humidity (which makes it difficult for sweat to evaporate), extra caution is needed. The trick, therefore, is to keep drinking a lot. However, your body can only absorb a certain amount of fluid and if the loss is still greater than the absorption, the body will still dehydrate. Nevertheless, there are ways to increase the absorption, for example by taking sports drinks.\nWhich sport drink?\nThe distinction in the type of sports drinks is mainly based on their osmolarity, or the number of dissolved particles of sugars and salts.  A drink is hypotonic if it contains fewer dissolved particles than the blood, this is the case with water. The problem with water is that the lack of dissolved particles causes it to pass too quickly through the gastrointestinal tract. Too quickly to allow for it to be absorbed properly. But if you drink the water while also taking a gel, the ratio in your stomach is already different of course. An isotonic sports drink has the same osmolarity as the blood. The fluid is absorbed much better than water, because it passes through the body more slowly. An energy drink or hypertonic sports drink, on the other hand, contains more dissolved particles than the blood. This allows the body to easily absorb sugars, but the fluid is again not absorbed as quickly. Hypertonic drinks are therefore essential to replenish the supply of sugars, while an isotonic sports drink stimulates the absorption of fluids much better than water.\nHow much per hour?\nUnder normal circumstances, your body absorbs no more than 750 ml to 1 liter of fluid per hour. However, you can lose more per hour, but drinking more than that makes little sense. What does make sense is to drink the right beverage. This is because by sweating you lose a lot of minerals (also called electrolytes). These minerals, such as sodium and potassium, are essential for proper muscle function. The loss of minerals is even considered one of the main causes of muscle cramps. So, especially in warm conditions, in addition to supplementing your carbohydrates, you need to make sure you have a good strategy with an isotonic sport drink with sufficient minerals.\nCycling in the heat – last advice\nSo especially at high temperatures, high humidity and the absence of wind, extra care is needed. Even with a good hydration strategy, dehydration can be lurking, as the loss of fluids can be greater than the absorption capacity. When the ride is long enough, symptoms such as nausea, a dark urine color, headaches and loss of performance can occur. In addition, the heart rate increases at the same power level because the loss of fluid decreases the blood volumes. In order to pump the same amount of blood to the organs and muscles, the heart rate goes up. This is called heart rate decoupling in exercise physiology. Take these symptoms seriously and adjust the duration and intensity of your rides to the weather conditions!"

    "content": "Training with a power meter is more than just mounting the meter and connecting it to your Garmin or Wahoo. During your first ride you will see those power numbers jumping all over the place. And after a couple of rides with slightly higher average power numbers every time, you wonder what those numbers actually mean. Somewhat exaggerated, we sometimes say that when you buy a guitar, you can’t play the guitar right away. Although much less complex, this also applies to training with a power meter. We explain why in this article.\nNo delay\nTraining with a power meter allows you to see what your body does in terms of output delivered immediately. You do not have to wait for the physiological response as you do with heart rate, nor does the power meter take external factors into account. But still, despite the immediate availability of the data, if you don’t have a reference, you still don’t really know anything.\nKnow your FTP\nSo you must have this reference point if you want to benefit from training with a power meter. For this you need two things. First of all, you need to map your own performance. The most common way to do this is by determining your FTP. This is the maximum power you should be able to sustain for an hour. You can have this determined accurately with an exercise test in a lab or you can do a DIY, 20-minute test yourself on the road or on an indoor trainer.\nListen to your intuition\nBut in addition, you especially need to heed your intuition. One day is always different from the next; on a bad day you will have a lower FTP and therefore the power you are aiming for should also be lower. On a good day, of course, the reverse is true. Also, on a hot day you can lose more fluid than you can absorb or when it is cold and your blood flow is constricted, you cannot expect your performance level and thus your power output to be unaffected. So don’t just look at the numbers, listen to your legs and body as well.\nPractical cycling tips\nFinally, below we list some more useful tips that will help you get started just a little faster. The most important two, know your FTP and listen to your intuition, we have already given.\n\nDo not look too much at absolute power, but relate it to body weight. Even on the flat, wattage per kilogram often says more about someone’s level than absolute power.\nNever use instantaneous power in the display of your cycling computer. This jumps up and down too much. We recommend 3-second power as the most useful metric.\nIn addition to the 3-second power value, you can also put a 30-second value and a 1-minute value on the screen. These are even less volatile and are useful to show what you are doing during your intervals.\nFocus on a constant cadence and feeling and not on a constant power. If you are constantly looking at your screen and trying to adjust your power output based on that, you will go nuts. Find a comfortable rhythm and gearing and then see if the power is about where you want it to be. Don’t look at the screen every 3 seconds to see if it is.\nDo not try to improve your average power on every ride. For example, a heavy interval training has a relatively low average power. It is better to look at normalized power (NP), which better reflects the variation in power and the strain on your body.\nNormalized power mainly works for stretches of at least 20 minutes. For short intervals the calculation of normalized power can give a distorted picture.\nEveryone has a left-right difference and that difference varies. In general, it gets smaller at higher Watts because you are engaging more muscle groups. So even if you are convinced that your left leg is weaker and you have a power meter that only measures your left leg, it makes very little sense to put your settings at 49-51% because the difference is not always the same. Don’t worry too much about any left-right differences. At a steady endurance pace, a deviation of 5% is quite normal.\nReplace the battery on time. Almost all power meters start giving wrong values when the battery voltage gets too low.\nAbove all, compare your power with your own values. The power meter that always and consistently measures what it should has yet to be invented. Unfortunately, different brands often show large deviations that make it very difficult to compare the reading of those various meters.\n\nTrain on hearth rate or power?\nAnd for the most important tip, a separate paragraph. If you train on power, only use heart rate in your analysis afterwards. In an ideal world when you ride in a certain power zone, your heart rate at that same moment is in the corresponding heart rate zone. However, this is not always the case. Because your heart rate has a delay, because you just overdid it in a very hard stint, because you trained hard yesterday, because you lost too much fluid, because you have stress at work, because you trained late in the day and were a bit tired, because you just had a strong cup of coffee, etcetera, we can go on for a while. So don’t go looking for this ideal world, but if you have a power meter just train on power. Afterwards you can check if the heart rate roughly matched what you did and if not then try to explain why not. If you don’t find the explanation, there is no need to panic. If your heart rates and power output remain far apart over multiple sessions, you should ask yourself whether your threshold heart rate and FTP are correct or whether something else (structural) is going on. Until then, nothing to worry about!"

    "content": "This is perhaps one of the most frequently asked questions. While we don’t give concrete buying advice for buying a powermeter, also because we don’t know the size of your wallet, there are a few things to consider. If you take these tips into account with your search, the choice will probably become a lot easier.\nWhat does a power meter measure?\nA power meter is little more than a very thin strip of metal (the strain gauge) that measures how much it is deformed when force is applied to it. In doing so, a power meter must also know the pedaling frequency (rpm), because force times speed equals power. With the right calibration and thus the measurement of this deformation and cadence, a number is calculated and sent to the bike computer that shows you the delivered power. This principle is the same for every power meter, but can be applied in different places on the bike.\nCompatability\nPower can be measured on the bottom bracket or spider (SRM, Quark, Rotor, Power2Max), at the cranks (Shimano, Stages, 4iiii), pedals (Garmin, Favero, Powertap) or at the rear wheel (Powertap). There are some other exotic solutions on the market, but they do not improve on the other offerings in terms of reliability and repeatability (more on this later). A rear wheel or pedals are super easy to mount, but then you are stuck with that one wheel or a specific pedal system. A spider system or crankset requires a bit more assembly work, often you have to replace the whole crankset, but then you don’t have this problem.\nReliability of the Power Meter\nAnother thing to consider is the reliability of the power meter. Does the power meter measure what you want to measure? If you pedal at 200 Watts, does the power meter indicate 200 Watts? There are many blogs about this where power meter readings are compared. This seems super important, but actually it’s not. A power meter is mainly a tool to improve yourself and to compare your power values with your own previous power values. If your power meter is always 20 Watts off, it does not matter that much. You only have to be careful not to compare your power with someone else’s. This is also why the cheaper option of a single-sided power meter is actually fine for almost every recreational cyclist. A single-sided power meter is only mounted on the non-drive side and multiplies the measured power on that side by two. This factor can often be adjusted with the bike computer. Nobody pedals at exactly 50% of his or her total power with the left leg all the time. But as long as you compare the reading with your own values from the same power meter, this doesn’t matter that much.\nRepeatability\nThe fact that a power meter indicates 200 Watts one day and 220 Watts the next is a much bigger problem. This is about the repeatability of the measurements. For example, when the battery begins to run out and the voltage declines, almost all power meters will begin to show more variability. In a general sense, new power meters that have just come on the market have problems in this area. It often takes a few generations before all the small problems are discovered and solved.\nOur advice in buying a Power Meter\nBuy a power meter that is easy to mount on your bike without too many modifications. If you already have a Shimano crankset, ask yourself if you want to replace it with a SRAM or Rotor system. Probably not. In addition, choose a power meter that has been on the market for a while and has been through its teething problems. If a single-sided power system fits your current crankset and if you mainly want to compare the power with yourself, go for a single-sided system. If you insist on a power meter that you can easily switch between, say, your time trial bike and road bike, consider a pedal system or rear wheel hub system."

    "content": "It may sound easy, but in practice doing interval training sessions outdoors is not at all that simple. Inside, on the indoor trainer, you can see your goal and performance at any point in time, because you don’t have to watch the roads and the traffic. In ERG-mode it’s only a matter of pedaling. You don’t have this luxury outdoors, but with good preparation and these tips you can successfully do your interval training outdoors.\nChoose the right route\nDecide in advance where you are going to do your intervals. Take into account the direction of the wind. High intensity intervals with the wind in your back is very difficult and dangerous in traffic. Further, you don’t always have to do a perfect loop. For example, if you have found a good and quiet stretch of road or a small, quiet course, ride it back and forth. This may sound boring, but it allows you to focus on the job at hand and will deliver better results.\nNever shorten the rest intervals\nAlways make sure that you stick to the prescribed intervals’ intensity. It is fine to make the rest intervals a little longer, for instance if that allows you to reach a better location to start the next interval. But never shorten the rest intervals, but be flexible with extending them. Only in short intervals with many repetitions in a row the precise execution of effort and recovery is important for the right training stimulus. This applies, for example, to 40/20’s 30/15’s and 50/10’s with 5 to 15 repetitions. Here it’s all about not fully recovering before exerting yourself again. You should always try to complete these kinds of sets, which often last around 10 minutes.\nYou will also notice that the intervals are often scheduled in the middle of a training session. This is not really necessary and you can change that to suit your route, climbs or the wind direction. In general, it is no problem to move the very high intensity intervals to the earlier part of the training and move the lower intensity work towards the end. Just make sure the body is sufficiently warmed up before you start your intervals.\nSync with your bike computer\nBack in the day when bike computers weren’t as sophisticated as they are today, it was still possible to do interval training! By knowing what your zones were and remembering what the plan for the day was, it was not that complicated. You could even write the instructions on a piece of masking tape and stick it on the top tube or stem of your bike. Of course, the bike computer is really helpful, but don’t become a slave to your Garmin/Wahoo and start intervals on locations where you really shouldn’t, just because your computer said so! (all of them have a “pause” button!).\nTrain in the spirit of the training\nThis tip also applies to more experienced cyclists. If you have been adhering to the training schedule meticulously, you can start playing around with the intensity a little bit more, for example in a group ride. If there are long tempo/D2 blocks scheduled, you can do them by doing some extra pulls on the front without paying too much attention to the length of the interval and the recovery time in between. You can try this when you are more experienced and have a good feel for what you are doing.\nMake sure you have the right company\nIf you’re going out on a ride with other people and you’re planning to do interval training, make the other person aware of this. It is often assumed that the other person won’t join you in those efforts, but it is actually a lot of fun and challenging to do interval training together. A training session with sprints is even better to do together than on your own. Just let your ride mate(s) know well in advance, so that they can adjust the intensity of their training in the days before or after.\nYou do not always have to do Interval Training\nA long, steady endurance training without interval training is often a good addition to short intensive work. The EnduroCo app also encourages you to do group rides, which the app takes into account and adjusts the training schedule in the days before and after. Just make sure you have the right balance, because if you never do intervals, you’ll find that over time you won’t improve by much."

    "content": "To train properly, you need to be able to determine the intensity of your workout. It is not just afterwards that you want to know how hard the training was on your body. Also during the training it helps to know what you are doing. You can of course do this by feel or by looking at the speedometer. But especially for less experienced cyclists, training on intuition is difficult if you haven’t developed good reference points. In addition, speed seems a particularly bad advisor when it’s windy! Therefore, heart rate monitors (and later: power meters) are the most commonly used methods to determine intensity. Heart rate monitors are cheap and reliable, while power meters are becoming more widespread and also increasingly cheaper. What is the big difference between training on heart rate and on power?\nThe two problems with heart rate training\nIt is interesting to know how hard a training session is on your body. That actually determines how tired you become, how much rest you need afterwards, and, in the long run, how much you will improve. Viewed this way, heart rate could be a more interesting training tool than power. However, there are two major problems with heart rate:\n\nThe relationship between heart rate levels and how hard the training is on your body varies from day to day\nThe heart rate reacts to a rise in intensity with a considerable delay.\n\nNevertheless, even your power output is also not always the same. Every day is different and that means that on some days your performance (or FTP) is slightly lower, making the same power output feel relatively harder. However, you cannot adjust the FTP every day. Therefore, when training on power as well as on heart rate, it is important to always listen to what you feel.\nstarting too fast and ending too easy.\nYour heart rate, but also the speed at which it rises and falls, can be different from day to day. Factors that influence this, often in combination, include: fatigue, altitude, reduced blood volume (after a week of not cycling), caffeine, diet, stress, dehydration.\nEven on a good day without all these influences, there is still the problem of lag. Using a HR meter, you have to determine the intensity in the first few minutes of an interval on intuition and then find out if you didn’t start too fast or too easy. If you don’t do this, as often happens in practice, then you often train too hard at the beginning of the interval and actually train another energy system and too easy at the end. It can therefore happen that someone who does an interval on heart rate ends up training in two completely different zones than was actually intended. Although you should also listen to the feeling and the form of the day with power, you have this problem to a much lesser degree. You can immediately target the power zone that is intended and stay there for the duration of the interval.\nWhat you need to know when training on heart rate.\nSo is training by heart rate useless? No, far from it, but consider these next few tips.\n\nListen to what you feel more than when training with power. Take into account that the heart rate can be higher towards the end of your training due to dehydration and fatigue, for example.\nEspecially up to 90% of your threshold heart rate, your heart rate is a pretty good indicator of what you’re doing. Above that, the delay is sometimes too great, as with short intervals, while fatigue may also play too big of a role at very high HR levels.\nAt short, all-out blocks above the threshold heart rate, do not look at the heart rate, but only listen to your body. The fact that sometimes, even though it was the intention, you don’t get above the threshold heart rate is not a problem. But if you fail to reach that level over a couple of training sessions, then it might be a good idea to find out why.\nDon’t start an interval too fast, but let the heart rate increase slowly. It is better to train a little shorter but in the planned zone, than to completely overshoot the goal.\nMake sure you know your threshold heart rate. Establish this in an exercise test in a lab or with a DIY field test. Make sure you regularly do a re-test (at least once a year).\nDo not work with formulas such as 220 minus your age. The results of these kinds of calculations can be too wide off the mark.\n\nFinally\nTraining with a heart rate meter is a good stepping stone to training with power. Once you have mastered it, you will also more easily understand how to use a power meter. When training with power you can keep wearing the heart rate monitor, but you must be careful not to always compare heart rate and power. Why, we explain in another article; Why can’t I aways compare my power and heart rate."

    "content": "One of the most beautiful things about cycling is that everyone, young and old, can still improve. In other sports that involve more power and explosive efforts, that’s often more difficult. In addition to the physical part of cycling, you can improve a lot more. For example, you can improve your sleep habits, nutrition, recovery, gear, tactics or the mental part of cycling.\nSome of this is easy to measure. For example, you can use an app to calculate your calorie intake and compare it with the calories you burned according to your bike computer. It is also possible to use your mobile phone or smartwatch to keep track of the quality of your sleep. By adding more regularity to your sleep pattern you can easily gain an hour’s sleep or even improve the quality of it.\nKeeping track of the physical progress is a little more complicated. Of course there are plenty of programs that show you nice charts, but what exactly do you have to look for? And how can you see if you’re making progress?\nHow to measure progress with cycling\nFirst of all, we must ensure that progress can be measured objectively. But of course it is also very important to listen to your body that you are on the right track. Your feelings are especially important when you have been ill or feel exhausted. But for now, we look at indicators that can objectively show your progress. You can do this by following a standardized protocol that tracks your progress. To chart your fitness precisely, you need to make it measurable, objective and reproducible. This way you can take the same measurement before and after a period of training and compare the results.\nYou can do this by measuring your speed over the same lap and see if your average speed has improved. But of course weather conditions have a big influence on your speed, especially the wind, temperature and air pressure. For example, many recreational cyclists can ride an average of 30 km/h on their fixed lap in summer while they average only manage 28 km/h in winter when the air is “thicker”. Where their fitness could actually be the same. So speed is not the measure of fitness or progress. But what do you have to measure then? Actually there is one clear answer: power.\nFTP test\nTo really measure the progress of your endurance, you need to check how long you can hold a certain level of power. A common way is to look at the maximum power you can hold for 20 minutes, with an FTP test. To measure this you also need to make sure your test is standardized. So do the test under the same conditions, on the same course, use the same power meter, do the same warm up and make sure you have taken as much rest as before the other tests. With this in mind, it is advisable to do it indoors on a home/smart trainer rather than outdoors where the weather can be an unpredictable factor. Not to mentions the roads and the other road users.\nBut is the value of just your 20 minutes of power the best way to determine your progress? That depends on your personal goals. If you want to ride a 15-40 minute climb as fast as possible, this value is a very good yardstick. But if you’re training for a 200 km ride with short climbs, this value is a lot less interesting. To get a broader picture of your fitness you can also do standardized 1- and 5-minute tests. Combined, these can determine your ‘power profile’.\nWhat is a power profile\nA power profile is a graph or table that shows your best power for each time interval, often between 10 seconds and 3 hours. It shows the maximum power output over the last 3 months or the best ever. Improvement of power at a certain time interval shows your improvement quite simply. Determining a power profile is currently the most widely used way in cycling to map progress. But this method does not contain everything you want to know. Often it’s not about how fast you ride up one mountain, but how fast you ride up the fifth or maybe even twentieth mountain of the day. Deep in the final of a race like the Tour of Flanders, the boys get separated from the men. After >200 km of racing, cobbles and steep climbs, someone’s power profile is less important; it’s all about the power you can still push in those final kilometers. Which rider has the most power left after such a long race?\nSummarize\nLet’s summarize. First of all; No matter how young or old you are, make sure you have a goal to work towards so that you know in what area you want or need to improve. Next, it is important that you test yourself regularly. Please note that not every training should be a test. Test yourself with a standardized test, every 4 to 6 weeks is more than enough to know if you are on the right track. Last but certainly not least, look not only at your maximum power but also at the power you can still deliver in the last hour of a heavy training or competition.\n\nWith this in mind, you have a sufficient base of knowledge. Determine your goal and what is needed to achieve it. Then make a plan and stick to it! If you do not feel comfortable doing it on your own, a trainer can help you make a plan and a schedule that also provides a great incentive."

    "content": "For months you have been training for a certain goal. You have already done all the workouts and it won’t be long before you can put the hammer down. It is then advisable to start tapering. If you do this well, you can improve between 0.5% and 6%. In this article we will describe what tapering is, why you should and in some cases should not or taper differently and how you can best approach this in a practical sense.\nWhat is tapering?\nTapering is reducing the training load in the final period before your goal. It may sound contradictory, because you still want to train hard to build up as much fitness as possible. But the idea behind it is to appear more rested at the start. At the moment you start the taper period, you have actually done all the training work and the only thing you can still gain at that moment is reducing fatigue. You can lower the training load by training for less time (volume), by making the training sessions less demanding (intensity) or by reducing the number of training sessions (frequency).\nWhy should I tapering?\nHow you appear at the start of your goal is largely determined by your stamina. You have built up this physical condition by training. Besides fitness, fatigue also has a big influence on how you will perform during your goal event. This can be put in the following equation:\nForm = fitness – fatigue\nYour form indicates the degree of performance at a given moment. So when you have trained a lot, your condition will be good, but you will still be tired from all the training work you have done. At that moment you will not be able to perform at your best, because you are simply still tired. When you have done little training, your fatigue will be low, but your condition will also be low in this case. Also in this case you will not appear at the start in your best shape. When you start tapering, you will look for the optimum of this form. After a period of taper, your muscle glycogen stores will have been replenished, you will have produced more red blood cells and the activity of oxidative enzymes will also be higher than when you have chosen not to taper. This all results in better performance.\nHow should I taper?\nAs discussed earlier, there are multiple ways to reduce training load. Research shows that not every way of reducing training load is equally effective. The taper period can last between 3 and 28 days. Especially with mainly concentric loads without much muscle damage, as is the case with cyclists, the taper is usually a maximum of a 5 to 14 days. Furthermore, you should especially reduce the volume of the training sessions considerably. A 40% to 60% reduction in the volume of training sessions appears to be the best strategy. The distribution of intensity and frequency of the workouts should remain the same. Furthermore, the intensity during your workouts should be very specific and therefore resemble the effort for which you are training as much as possible.\nPractical considerations\nThis strategy is quite easy to apply when you have only one goal where you want to peak. If you have multiple goals or, for example, ride races weekly during the season, this strategy is not possible. Tapering for two weeks before each race would result in a big decrease in fitness and ultimately your form. So in that case you will have to prioritize your different goals. Depending on how important the goal is, you and your coach will determine the best way to tapering. Also, factors such as acclimatizing to a different climate, performing at altitude or the jet lag after a long trip can have a big influence on the best way to tapering.\nConclusions\nIf you want to get the most out of yourself, tapering is absolutely recommended. However, it is not always possible to use the most optimal strategy. Also, logistical or other external factors can play a role in planning a taper period. It is therefore advisable to determine together with your coach which goal you attach the most value to and how you can tapering as well as possible. And perhaps the most important: trust your condition, do not continue training too long."

    "content": "In a previous article we discussed the Critical Power model. This model consists of two components. In the Critical Power article we focused mainly on the aerobic component, in this article we look at the other one, the anaerobic work capacity component. This anaerobic work capacity is especially important during short, intensive efforts. Think a short, steep climb, or an attack in the last kilometers of a race.\nAnaerobic energy tank\nAnaerobic work capacity (also called AWC or W’) can best be seen as an energy tank that represents the size of your anaerobic energy system. The larger this tank, the more power you can release above your Critical Power level. So you have power over short efforts of a few minutes, but also more power over a longer duration, like the 20-minute test that we referred to in the previous article. To calculate how much ‘anaerobic’ energy you can release we need to know the exact size of your AWC tank. The amount is calculated as an amount of kJ (kilojoules). When this AWC tank is empty you are no longer able to ride above your threshold point and you will have to recover before you can go back above it. The body recovers from an anaerobic effort via the aerobic system, which can, among other things, burn the lactate aerobically and thereby ‘refill the tank’.\nThe bigger the better?\nWe now know that AWC is very important for (repetitive) short efforts. It is therefore easy to think that the bigger this tank, the better it is. To a certain extent this is true. However, the body is so adaptive that one comes at the cost of the other, so an increase in AWC can go at the expense of your FTP. This is because the body produces lactate faster when it becomes more anaerobic; therefore, it will tend to produce more and faster lactate at lower intensities.\nWhether it is advisable and important to increase your AWC depends entirely on your goal. If you are training for a long cyclo, it is smarter to make sure you are aerobically fit and you need to focus less on AWC. If you are training for a short criterium of an hour, then the anaerobic energy is basically all that matters!\nFor example, if we look at a 20 minute test (1200 seconds), a person with a low AWC (12000 KJ) can release 10W ‘anaerobically’ over 20 minutes (12000 KJ/1200 sec= 10W). A person with a very high anaerobic capacity (36000 KJ) can release 30 W over these 20 minutes (36000/1200=30W). If both persons can ride at a 300W average over 20 minutes this means a Critical Power of 290W for one and 270W for the other. A substantial aerobic difference!\n\nHow do I train awc?\nBecause these are very intensive efforts, it is important that you are rested and fresh when you start these training sessions. In addition, you should also ensure that you are fully recovered when you start the next repetition, so the rest between the blocks is very long. Think of blocks of 30 sec to 2 minutes full throttle, after which you cycle for 5-10 minutes on low intensity to work the lactic acid back out of the legs. Strength training in the gym can also increase your anaerobic work capacity.\nThe great advantage of the anaerobic system is that it responds very quickly to training, it is really a matter of a few weeks before this system has improved. The aerobic system takes much more time to develop.\nConclusion\nThe importance of anaerobic energy depends on your goal. An increase in the anaerobic system can go at the expense of the aerobic system, so it is important to plan the training plan with care. Always consider in which phase you should schedule the anaerobic workouts and make sure that you do them fresh and rested! In addition, the calculations of performance and energy systems are obviously a model, whose calculations are much dependent on the quality of the input. So look critically at your data before drawing conclusions."

    "content": "You may have already come across the term Critical Power (CP) in relation to the Threshold Power. Sometimes functional threshold power (FTP) and Critical Power are used interchangeably, but that is not correct. Although both values are often close to each other, there is a clear difference. FTP is the power you can sustain for a maximum of one hour while CP is the power you can theoretically sustain for much longer. Critical Power is the lower limit (or horizontal asymptote) of someone’s power curve. To explain how this works we must first explain what a power curve is.\nMean maximal power curve.\nMean Maximal Power (MMP) is the amount of power you can produce for a given time. In 10 seconds you can produce more power than you can in 1 minute or longer. Using an MMP model it is possible to get an indication of how much energy can be released from which energy system per unit of time.\nTo produce energy the human body has 3 different energy systems at its disposal. The goal of all these systems is always to release ATP (adenosine triphosphate), because this is the energy you can actually use to run/ride, etcetera.\nThe three energy systems.\nThese various energy systems each have their peculiarities as described below:\n\nCreatine phosphate system: also called the sprint system. This form of energy is stored in the muscles and is therefore immediately available. It allows you to release a lot of power very quickly. But after 8-15 seconds this energy system is depleted and you will see a clear decrease in power. It is especially important during sprints.\nAnaerobic: The anaerobic system is good at releasing energy relatively quickly, it does this by burning glycogen without the use of oxygen. This process is still quite fast which makes it useful for short efforts. Think, for example, of a viaduct or short climb that you ride up at full speed. The disadvantage is that you acidify due to an increase in H+ ions. These ions literally cause acidification of the muscles, which decreases the function and forces you to reduce your intensity at some point.\nAerobic: The aerobic system releases energy by burning fats and carbohydrates with oxygen. It is a relatively slow system but can be maintained for a long time as long as sufficient fuel is added. The carbohydrates stored in the body can provide energy for 1-1.5h of intensive effort, the energy you can get from body fats is enough for a few days of effort. Also for very skinny athletes! This energy system is therefore suited to long duration efforts.\n\nOf course, all these energy systems work together and side by side. Depending on what kind of effort you do, one system is more or less active. If we therefore chart all your best power readings per unit of time, it will look something like this.\nHow to make a power curve.\nBy doing a number of power tests it is possible to draw your power curve. You do this for example in an anaerobic field test, where you test your best power over 1 minute and 5 minutes. This simply means that after a good warm-up, you go all out in a 1-minute and 5-minute effort, with sufficient rest between both efforts. Based on these values we can calculate the curve and then derive your CP. Note that the more maximal efforts we have, for example also 8, 12, 20 and 40-minute maximal efforts, the more accurate the power curve will be.\nCritical power is calculated by looking at where the graph flattens out, this so-called asymptote. CP stands for the aerobic energy that you can release, it corresponds to FTP but it is not quite the same. FTP is the actual power you can ride over 60 minutes, CP gives an indication of the size of your aerobic system and is therefore slightly lower.\n\nThe area above the critical power line.\nThe area above CP is called AWC (anaerobic work capacity), which reflects the anaerobic system. This is a tank of energy that can be drained over varying lengths of time, from 1 minute to 20 minutes. In fact, it is a tank of Joules (energy) that you can spread out over a period of time. When the tank is completely empty you can fall back on Critical Power. Some comments should be added here. This is a highly theoretical model that describes the reality and functioning of systems quite well, but the real life practice is always more stubborn. We explain Anaerobic Work Capacity here in another blog.\nWhat can you do with it?\nImagine you do a 20-minute test and the result is 15W better than 3 months ago. Obviously you have improved over 20 minutes, but we do not know by how much your FTP has improved. It may be that your anaerobic tank has become larger and that you have improved just above your threshold power. As a result, your aerobic system may have increased by only 5W. It is therefore important to create a power curve by testing multiple peak values so you can make it a two- or more components model. By doing this it is possible to get a better indication of which energy system has improved after a period of training or on which energy system you should focus more in the run up to your goal events.\nConclusion.\nThrough the CP model it is possible to split your performance into two components; aerobic and anaerobic. This makes it easier to set and evaluate your training results. It is very important that you do this with someone who knows what he is doing and how to calculate, use and interpret the model."

    "content": "You will undoubtedly have heard of carbohydrate stacking, aka carboloading. What exactly is it and when does it make sense to do it? In this article, we’ll go over the do’s and don’ts.\nCarbohydrate Storage\nAt low intensity, a well-trained endurance athlete can generate his or her energy needs mostly from fats. However, even at low intensity, part of the energy will always come from carbohydrates and this proportion increases as the intensity increases. These carbohydrates are the primary source of energy at high intensity. How long you can sustain this high intensity depends mainly on the amount of carbohydrates stored in the body. So it sounds logical to make sure this supply is as large as possible before you line up at the starting gun.\nGlycogen\nYour body can at most store about 600 to 750 grams of carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are stored in the liver and the muscles in the form of glycogen. This amount can be used for a maximum of 90 minutes at full throttle (or FTP) and then that tank will have been emptied. So for most cycling activities, just making sure your stores are full at departure is not enough. You will also need to try to keep replenishing the carbohydrates supplies while cycling.\nMaximize replenishment\nIn the old days, the tried and true method was to first completely deplete the storage by training hard and eating as little carbohydrate as possible for a week beforehand, and then replenish that storage completely in the last few days before the event. We now know that the storage can be replenished to the same level without first going though that depletion phase. The only thing you need to do is to reduce the training load considerably in the last few days and increase the carbohydrate intake.\nTapering\nThe reduction of training load is called “tapering“. It ensures that you are well rested for the “moment suprême”. Because you’ll also miss some training, you don’t want to make this period too long or your form will begin to fade. How long is very personal. Some people feel better with five days of very calm training, while others only need one or two rest days to feel fresh and well-rested again.\n24-hour stacking\nTo ensure that the maximum capacity in the muscles and liver is used for glycogen storage, consumption of 8 to 10 grams of carbohydrates per day is recommended in the 24 hours before the event. For many cyclists this is not much more than their normal, daily intake. Especially in the Western world we already eat quite a lot of bread and pasta. A common mistake is to pile a lot more additional carbohydrates on top of that. Because once the glycogen stores are full, the additional carbs are stored as fat and that’s of little use to you as a cyclist.\nWeight gain\nWhat you should keep in mind is that every gram of stored carbohydrate is accompanied by 3 grams of water. So with a full tank of carbohydrates you also drag along up to 2 liters of water. Therefore, stacking carbohydrates really only makes sense for very long, hard efforts and has little benefit for a shorter race or time trial.\nEating too much\nAnother common mistake is to eat huge amounts of carbohydrates on the day itself. The night before D-day, the carbohydrate stacking should have been completed, but don’t go crazy at the evening’s pasta buffet. On the morning of the ride, a ‘normal’ breakfast with about 60 to 90 grams of carbs should be sufficient. Make sure you have eaten up to about 2 hours before the start and avoid fats and proteins in the morning. These overload the digestive system. You can take a sports drink (energy drink or carboloader) with around 40 grams of carbohydrates in the two hours before departure, but more is really not necessary. Wolfing down a huge stack of pancakes close to the start actually puts you out of contention before the race has even started!\nEat a variety of foods\nFinally, it is very important to stack carbohydrates in a varied way. After all, you absorb carbohydrates the best when they come from different sources and in many different forms. Especially the slower carbohydrates that your body absorbs more slowly, such as brown rice, spelt pasta and whole grain bread, are recommended as they can be transferred more easily into glycogen."

    "content": "What is FTP?\nNo bicycle race on television goes by without the commentators talking about FTP or power. More and more training plans are based on power. Maybe your training buddy just bought a power meter. As a cyclist you can’t ignore it, these days it’s all about power in cycling and often in the same sentence the expression FTP is used. Why do you need to look at power (and therefore a power meter)? In this article you will learn about the advantages of training with a power meter, knowing your FTP and how to improve.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTraining load monitoring\nA power meter is simply the best way to determine the training load. In the past, when athletes and cyclists wanted to monitor their training load, they started to do so in speed (km/h) and/or in time. But as you probably know, your speed is influenced by wind, temperature, altitude, etc. So speed is not the best way to analyze a training session or to monitor the training load.\nThe heart rate monitor was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s. A beautiful development, as the environment and circumstances have a much smaller influence on it. By measuring the heart rate, scientists and coaches thought they could measure exactly how hard your body actually works during a training session. But the knowledge about training grew and the heart rate turned out to be rather variable. It is influenced by factors such as temperature, altitude, stress, fatigue and fluctuates from day to day. Drinking a cup of coffee can boost your heart rate, while the training session doesn’t get any harder. So the heart rate as a valid and reliable way to measure training load was quickly questioned. As a result, the search for another way to determine the training load was embarked upon. If the heart rate had proved to be a valid and reliable way, the power meter would probably never have been invented. The power meter was introduced in the early 1990s. Lance Armstrong was one of the first professional cyclists to use a power meter to monitor his training load.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tP=F*v.\nWhat is power anyway? In mechanics, the formula is power: Power = Force x Speed (P=F*v). This means on a bike; the force on your pedals multiplied by the distance your pedals cover (measured as cadence). Power is a direct measure of your output, which is not influenced by external factors. Power instead of heart rate is also capable of monitoring improvement. As you improve, the power you can produce over a certain time interval will improve. This is not possible if you use speed or heart rate, your heart rate and speed could be the same while you are delivering more power.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFunctional Threshold Power / FTP.\nSo with power, we can finally see what you’re really doing. In order to have a good idea of how heavy a certain exercise is for you personally, or to be able to make a good training schedule, we use training zones. There are different ways to classify the power zones. In the EnduroCo Cycling app, we use five zones based on your FTP. Your FTP can be determined by doing an exercise test. An exercise test shows you what you are good at and in what areas you can improve the most: it gives you insight into your aerobic and anaerobic threshold. A slightly less accurate way to determine your FTP is through a DIY, 20-minute test that you do on your indoor trainer or out on the road. This is actually a time trial of 20 minutes preceded by a good warm-up. 95% of the average power over those 20 minutes is a good estimate of your FTP.\nOften the FTP power is divided by your weight, so you get a relative power in Watts per kilogram. This is a good way to bring the important role that your weight plays into the equation. That matters a lot with climbing. But in a sprint, on the other hand, it’s the absolute, raw power that counts!\nDidm’t you do a proper FTP test yet, or do you not have a power meter and do you still want an indication of your FTP? Then calculate your FTP based on your speed with our unique FTP calculator.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPower meters.\nPower meters are getting cheaper and cheaper. The most reliable power meters are the ones that sit in your bottom bracket or in advanced indoor smart trainers. Most power meters promise an accuracy of +/- 2%, with the smart trainers this is only +/- 1%. Power meters can also be in the crank or in your pedals and when power is measured on both sides they can show the balance between right and left. Some power meters only measure left, a cheaper alternative, but not the most reliable.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHow to get better.\nGetting better is all about timing. There are actually no good or bad workouts. There is only a bad combination or the wrong workout at the wrong time. The path to progress is therefore a training plan with the right training stimulus, taking into account your level, goal and available time. To help you with that we developed an algorithm in the EnduroCo Cycling application. It provides you with a highly flexible and personalized training plan to make sure that you make the most out of your rides.\nAfter reading how much you can improve your Functional Threshold Power (FTP; the power you can sustain for 60 minutes), it is equally important to know how you can realize that! In many cycling groups, the discussion quickly turns to someone’s FTP. It is considered the benchmark of someone’s cycling performance.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhy FTP?\nThe FTP appears to be seen as the true cyclist performance indicator and is linked to almost every discipline in cycling that takes 4 minutes or longer. It provides a real insight into someone’s aerobic metabolism and efficiency. We usually talk about the FTP in the context of power, but the heart rate at around the FTP level is called the threshold heart rate. So the power performance at the threshold heart rate is also the FTP. The FTP can be analyzed in 2 ways; namely in absolute terms (for example 300 W) or relative (for example 4 Watt/kg). Whereby the latter number is a good indicator for your speed on a climb. So the higher your FTP in terms of W/kg, the faster you will ride up the Alpe d’Huez. One kilogram less weight at the same power output can easily save you one minute on a climb of one hour. In this article we look at improving the absolute FTP. Obviously, you can even further increase the relative FTP by losing weight, but we save that part of the equation for another article.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhat is the best thing to do to improve my FTP\nTo Train! Actually, it is the simplest answer there is, but also true: as long as you get off the couch and jump on the bike you will start improving your FTP. In fact, there is basically no “bad” training to improve the FTP. Everything the aerobic system uses during training is basically a stimulus for the body. Of course, it is true that certain workouts and combinations of different workouts work better if you are looking to improve your FTP. In the past, people thought that training at the threshold heart rate/FTP would improve the FTP. So they did a lot of very hard workouts. But this also caused a lot of fatigue and often only a small increase in the FTP. In order to know which training sessions are the best, it is important to look at the various different elements of the performance at the threshold heart rate or FTP.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPhysiological components of the FTP point\nPhysiologically speaking, the FTP is the point at which the production and the breakdown of lactate are just about in balance still. In scientific literature this is also called the Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS). This means there is acidification, but it is kept under control and therefore sustainable over a longer period of time. Looking at the internal factors that determine FTP, there are actually three:\nVO2max: the maximum aerobic capacity. This intensity can only be maintained for 4-8 minutes as lactate production is much higher than breakdown of it. This forms the ceiling of your aerobic efforts.\nFTP as a percentage of VO2max: the equilibrium of the lactate production/breakdown. At untrained riders this will be around 50%, while pro riders in the Tour de France can hit 90%.\nEfficiency: how much power your body can release per liter of oxygen at the turning point. A high VO2max is of course nice, but if your body is not very efficient you will not notice much of it when you are out on the road.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTraining to improve the FTP\nNow that we know out of which 3 components the FTP consists, we want to train them individually. Below we indicate which type of training is specific to these three components. Not entirely in random order!\nThe long endurance training: endurance training in which the length of the training mainly determines the effect. Riding harder during your endurance training therefore makes little sense; it only brings more fatigue while it does not strengthen the stimulus itself. Because the muscles are continuously loaded during your endurance training, this is a very strong stimulus for the aerobic system, as it ensures an increase of the mitochondria (energy factories) in the muscles. The more mitochondria you have (and the better they function) the higher your VO2max, but also the better the body is at buffering the lactate that is being generated while exercising. So the long ride increases your VO2max, improves efficiency and, most importantly, increases the FTP as a percentage of your VO2max.\nThreshold: or long intervals (95-105% FTP). These long intervals (4-15 minutes) at or just above the threshold provide a specific stimulus for the FTP. They really make you better at tolerating and breaking down the lactic acid created by training at a high percentage of the VO2max. The problem with these stimuli is that they are also very tiring and therefore should not be done very often.\nVO2max: or short intervals (105-120% FTP). These short intervals (2-5 min) are especially effective for improving the VO2max itself, so they help to lift the threshold levels. During the short intervals you are really at the limit of your aerobic system.\nTempo/Sweetspot intervals: long blocks below the threshold. Because the intensity is below the threshold, around 85-95% FTP, the body remains in a steady state. This makes it easier to spend more time at a relatively high percentage of VO2max. If you also execute these intervals at a somewhat lower cadence, this is a very good stimulus that will ensure an increase in efficiency.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tConclusion\nThere are many different ways that help to improve your FTP. Basically you can pick between two different approaches. The traditional method combines relatively frequent tempo and threshold training sessions, while the ‘modern’ approach mixes mainly long, steady endurance training with short, intense Vo2max training. This ‘new’ method is also called polarized training and you can read more about it in this article. Both approaches work and what is the best one for you depends on your training history and your goals. As mentioned earlier, there are several roads that lead to Rome. The most important thing is to see which aspect is the one where you can improve the most. You can find this out by properly mapping out your performance, for example by doing an exercise test."

In this article we give you tips and tricks to help you make the most out of your interval training.\nPreparation is half the work\nWhile it sounds rather obvious to do it, you’ll be surprised how often people skip reading the training instructions. Sometimes a rider just exports the training to a program like Zwift or to the Garmin, but that is not always necessary. For example, you can easily memorize 5 repetitions of 6 minutes, can you not? Initially, you could write your performance zones on a piece of masking tape that you stick on the top tube or the stem of your beloved steed, but after a few workouts you will know your zones. So doing a bit of homework helps and avoids that you spend as long on exporting a workout file to your headunit, as on the workout itself. In addition, be aware of the training goal. For example, if it is a sprint training, then the average speed over the entire workout is not of interest at all.\nWarming-up\nThe purpose of a warm-up is to prepare the body to perform. So this is especially important for efforts where you need to perform right from the gun, like a time trial. A warmed-up body performs better. Now, training is not about delivering the best performance, it’s about training well. Therefore, build up the first few minutes slowly and start low in the prescribed zone. However, there is no need to overdo it. 5 or 10 minutes can be enough before the real training starts.\nAccurate zones\nTraining session intensity is split up in zones. These zones are determined on the basis of your threshold heart rate or FTP (power output). This threshold can be determined in an exercise test in a sports lab or by doing a 20-minute field test yourself. It is important that this threshold is up-to-date. A trained person’s threshold heart rate threshold will remain fairly constant. A beginner can see a rise in this heart rate after a few months of training, while the reverse can also happen. The maximum heart rate and thus also the threshold-HR decrease with age.\nIn power terms, the training goal is to improve your FTP. A 20-minute test is therefore recommended every 2 to 3 months to check on the progress. An annual exercise test in a laboratory is also recommended because it encompasses a more general health check and not just measures your power output.\nListen to your legs\nWhen you are training, always listen to your body first, then pay attention to the power output and finally look at the heart rate. There are so many variables apart from effort that influence your heart rate (sleep quality, caffeine consumption, stress, etcetera) that your heart rate is a poor tool to measure the intensity of your efforts. Power output is a far more accurate and stable measure so heart rate zones and power zones will not always match. You should be aware that the ultimate goal is to train at a certain intensity and activate the specific energy system that are associated with that intensity. Achieving a certain heart rate is not a goal in itself and at best only a means. Training at a certain power level and thus stimulating a certain energy system is far more accurate and thereby conducive to training well. This is the big difference between training on heart rate and on power.\nThe pitfall with heart rate training.\nWhen you’ve eaten too little, have become dehydrated, gotten too little sleep, trained hard recently, drank a lot of coffee or are stressed at work: all these factors impact your heart rate. When you are well rested or have not trained for a while, your heart rate goes quite high, while the training feels relatively easy. Listen to that feeling first and to the heart rate second. Because every day is different, don’t aim for your HR to be exactly in the middle or near the top of an intensity zone. On a poor day you will be in the middle of the zone while on a good day you might be near the upper end of the zone’s bandwidth.\nEspecially with power training, it’s about keeping the efforts constant across the stints and being able to complete the prescribed number of repetitions. Therefore, always start the first repetition a little cautious. If you feel that it is going well, you can up the pace and gun for the top of the zone. For this very reason, always training in ERG-mode on your indoor trainer is not a good idea at all. The ERG-mode ensures that the power is kept exactly constant in the middle of the zone. That might be nice and easy, but on a bad day you cannot drop the power a little bit easily, nor push a little harder in the last few repetitions if you feel good.\nTraining with heart rate or power\nWorkouts in EnduroCo Cycling are often prescribed more precisely in power terms than in heart rate terms. This also means that when you train on heart rate, you should listen more carefully to your body and train higher or lower in the zone based on that. Making these heart rate zones very small or very precise in the descriptions of the workouts makes no sense for heart rate based training, where instructions whilst training on power can be more precise.\nCooling down\nAn interval training should never end right after the intensive intervals. It is always advisable to ride for at least 5 more minutes with a light gear. The higher the intensity of the training, the more waste products (lactic acid, etc) will have been produced that can be removed from your muscles with this “active recovery”. If you worry that your Strava averages will suffer from that cool down, our simple tip is to turn off the Garmin of Wahoo on the final, easy 5 to 10 minutes home stretch!\nEvaluation\nIt’s important to know whether you’ve done your workout properly. If, for example, the heart rates were outside the prescribed zones, but the feeling and power were not, there is probably an explanation for this. In sprint training you look at the speeds and power of the sprints. Achieving certain heart rates is a pointless goal because the sprints are too short. In the case of longer endurance training sessions with tempo intervals, the relationship between power and heart rate can be interesting: you can compare it to a similar workout a few weeks earlier to see if you are making progress."

    "content": "Perhaps this is the most frequently asked question that we, as cycling trainers, get asked. In this article we give an indication, with the necessary caveats, how much you can probably still improve.\nImprove on what?\nIn cycling, you can improve in several areas. Improving your sprint or short intensive efforts is very different from improving the ability to ride long or several days in a row. In general, the FTP, or the power that you (theoretically) can sustain for a maximum of one hour, is seen as a reference of your performance level. Improving your FTP is also an excellent goal for most recreational cyclists to sustain longer efforts (such as climbs), and also recover more quickly from such efforts. The FTP can be measured with an exercise test or (slightly less accurately) with a 20-minute, DIY field test: you go full throttle for 20 minutes like you would in a time trial that lasts for 20 minutes. 95% of the average power delivered over these 20 minutes is generally used as a reliable measure of your FTP.\nHow good are pros?\nFor a good comparison between individuals we divide the FTP by body weight. This way we get the power per kilogram at the FTP and eliminate the absolute power difference between heavy and light cyclists. So if you can lose a few pounds plus you manage to get your FTP up then the wattage per kilogram on the FTP can be a double winner. A Tour de France pro has an FTP between 5.5 W/kg and 6.5 W/kg (the highest number for the GC contenders). An untrained person usually sees scores between 1.5 to 2 W/kg (men) and 1.3 to 1.7 W/kg (women).\nAge effect with cycling\nAlthough the maximum power produced at very short intensive efforts such as sprinting falls with age, a cyclist should be able to continue to improve the FTP until the age of 40 to 45. Here we assume that someone is maximally trained. It is true that if you get older may need more training than a younger cyclist. After the age of 45, the challenge is more not to deteriorate rather than still improve. In practice, however, we often see quite fit 50-year-olds who are much healthier and more vital than they were in their 30s.\nShort and long-term improvement\nWe also see a fair number of recreational cyclists that do not improve at all year over year. Because after a good season, they put their legs up and what they have carefully built up over 9 months is completely undone in a 3-month rest period in the winter. In those 3 months, the VO2max will decline by 15 to 20%. Regaining that lost fitness will take much more than those three months. Therefore, we strongly recommend continuing to train, even at lower volumes. Taking longer rest periods of more than two weeks is actually never a good idea. Also, make sure you do a little more each year if you want to keep improving. The training volumes should increase a little each year so as not to reach a plateau in your training progress. Keep training and doing a little more each year is therefore essential to keep improving.\nNature or nurture\nSo training is important to keep improving, but ultimately everyone hits his or her ceiling. This ceiling depends on the genes you have inherited from your parents, and your talent. Ultimately, the Tour de France winners are freaks of nature who have reached an exceptional level of fitness after many years of training and dedication. Without this talent and with only hard training, not only would they never have won the Tour, but even turning pro would have been out of the question. In general, any healthy person, unless living a very unhealthy lifestyle, should be able to improve to at least 3-3.5 W/kg (men) and 2.5-3 W/kg (women) until the age of 40-45. After that, the inevitable aging becomes a complicating factor.\nConclusion\nWe can summarize the above in a table. It has become clear that to what extent someone can improve is a complex calculation with many variables. The point of departure, age, talent and over which period improvement can be expected are essential to begin with. Especially the degree of talent is impossible to predict. Furthermore, what your lifestyle looked like in the years before you started training seriously, is more relevant that your absolute age level. Until you are 45….\n\n\n\n\nIn 3 months\nIn 1 year\nLong term\n\n\n1-2 w/kg\n10-20%\n20-50%\n?\n\n\n2-3 w/kg\n5-15%\n10-40%\n?\n\n\nAbove 3 w/kg\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n\n\nThis table is therefore purely indicative and meant to give a rough idea of what factors are important. With the wide ranges we try to indicate that predicting the exact percentage of improvement is something for fortune tellers and not for cycling trainers.\nNow that you know by how much you can improve, the only question that remains is how to do it. We recommend you to take a look at our training plan application EnduroCo cycling. It provides you with a dynamic training plan that takes into account your level, your goal and your availability. It’s like working with a personal coach for a fraction of the cost."

    "content": "How precise is this FTP test?\nThe outcomes of these FTP calculations are as accurate as the input. The physics behind this equation is 100% exact, but to come to an outcome we have to make assumptions. The biggest resistance on the flat is the air resistance. For that it is important to know the frontal surface and how easy the air detaches from the cyclist and the bike. Therefore, it makes a difference if you sit up straight or in a time trial position or if you wear a normal helmet or a time trial helmet. This value is expressed as CdA (drag coefficient times frontal area) and can only be measured precisely in a wind tunnel. With this calculation we estimate this CdA value based on length, weight, type of bike and position. Especially with these estimates there can be quite a difference and the higher the speed the bigger the possible error. Besides that, we make certain assumptions about the rolling resistances and even the air density based on the temperature. Therefore use this calculator as a rough estimation only of your FTP. If you really want to take this to the next level then buy a power meter and do an exercise test in a performance lab."

    "content": "It might not be that cold outside yet, but winter is coming. The extent to which we as cyclists suffer from this cold differs from person to person. One person might claim that you just need the proper cycling gear, while another only does indoor rides when the mercury drops. Apart from this subjective experience of cold, this weather type also clearly has an objective impact on the human body. We are often asked whether it is actually a good idea to train outside with temperatures around zero degrees Celsius. In this article we try to give clear and scientifically based answers.\nTemperature is not the only measure for cold\nFirstly, it is important to consider how cold it actually is. Just the temperature is not a good measure for this. As cyclists, we know better than anyone else what the influence of the wind is and the wind is indeed a crucial factor. Because of the wind, the human body cools down faster. Therefore, the wind chill, which takes into account the force of the wind, is a much better measure for cold. A temperature of just below zero with a clear blue sky and a beautiful sun seems fine at first glance.\nHowever, with a Bft 4 wind from the east, the wind chill factor already drops the temperature to -9°C! And if you want to ride against that wind with a speed of 28 km/h, then the wind chill temperature is quite a bit lower still at about -13/-14°C. Temperatures so low have a big impact, so they should be taken seriously.\nWhat happens with your body when you train in the cold?\nAt a wind chill temperature below -15°C, cold injuries may occur after just an hour. Frostnip or even frostbite damage (possibly irreversible) can develop as ice crystals form in the tissue of exposed body parts, like fingers, toes, ears and/or nose. But even before that happens, other interesting reactions can already be seen in the human body. Vasoconstriction occurs to keep the core temperature at the required level. This protects the torso, where all vital organs lie, but constricts the blood flow to arms and legs.\nSo cycling in the cold means that the leg muscles get delivered significantly less blood and therefore less fuel and oxygen. And the disposal of waste products like lactic acid is also considerably reduced. Therefore, in temperatures around zero degrees Celsius, you will never be able to perform as well as in warmer weather. More interestingly, it makes the load on your body heavier than at higher temperatures, while the heart rate monitor or power meter might still suggest an equal performance. It is therefore important to realize that the level of effort for a given power level is considerably higher at low temperatures.\nDoes training in the cold speed up your metabolism?\nHowever, contrary to popular belief, the metabolism of exercise in the cold is not automatically higher than normal. The thinking is often that an increased metabolism burns more fats and carbohydrates and also thereby releases more heat. Nice idea, but for an increased metabolism, humans actually have to make more effort through increased muscle activity. This is, for example, what happens when you are shivering. As long as the core temperature is not compromised, because you wear the proper clothes to brave the cold, you will not sit shivering on the bike. In contrast to some animal species, humans do not have the ability to produce more heat due to increased activity of tissue other than muscle tissue. A bear, for instance, can turn up his internal “stove” a little bit during his hibernation. The popular belief likely developed from the fact that if you had dressed up in quite a few layers of winter clothing, your ease of movement was compromised and you had to work harder, thereby seeing a higher metabolism.\nWhy cyclists are the least capable of keeping their body temperature at a constant level\nAs mentioned, the body does everything it can to keep the temperature at a constant high level of at least 36°C. We as cyclists actually have all the possible factors that can complicate this working against us. The elements such as rain and wind play an important role. In addition, a low fat percentage also significantly complicates this task and research shows that well-trained individuals are no better at maintaining their core temperature than less trained people. By the way, cyclists over 60 face another hurdle, because the vasoconstriction works less at older age. Women have a small advantage in this context because on average their fat percentage is higher. But at the same fat percentage, women have a harder time again because on average the ratio between mass and surface is lower.\nWhat do you need to wear as a cyclist in the cold?\nTo help the body the best way is to create as many layers of clothes as possible. And two thin layers is always better than one thick layer. Although in cycling everything should always be as tight as possible given the importance of aerodynamics, the opposite is now the case. In this way, stagnant layers of air are created that adopt the temperature of the body. But things go wrong when overdoing it by wearing too much warm clothing, that also is not breathing very well. In that situation, water vapor generated by the body during exercise cannot find a way out. This causes the clothing directly on the skin to get wet. And riding back home for an hour or so with clothes that have become wet during some strenuous intervals is really a problem. These are precisely those situations where extra vigilance is required.\nBy the way, modern apparel fabrics make this cold management a lot easier than 20 years ago, but still it is important to think about it seriously and experiment. Finally, an underestimated element of cold weather training is the fluid intake. Because of the cold, there is less of an urge to drink. But in winter, quite a bit of water vapor escapes during hard efforts. Especially when the air is really dry, it is very possible to dehydrate. So please pay attention to the fluid balances. If you struggle taking swigs of cold fluid, consider insulated bidons with tea or other hot drinks.\nAdjust to the cold!\nFinally, the effects of acclimatization to the cold in the physiological field are quite limited. There is a small acclimatization, where the body learns to apply vasoconstriction a little faster and also heat production by muscle contraction is at a slightly higher level. The most important advice is to use common sense when riding in the cold, listen to your body and adjust the effort/distance to the conditions."

    "content": "Many cycling races end in a sprint. If it’s not a bunch sprint, it’s likely a leading group that sprints for the flowers or a classic sprint à deux that decides who stands on the highest step of the podium. Even some of the most gruesome mountain stages often see a sprint finish. So if you, as a cyclist, keep insisting that you can’t sprint, your chances to ever win a race are close to zero and you’d better start playing chess. Of course it’s a bit crazy that races of more than 200 km are only decided in the last 200 meters, but it is what it is! Which elements actually determine whether you can sprint well and how can you improve your sprint? In this article we will try to answer these questions.\nThe importance of peak power.\nWith the rise of the power meters, we can now get a nice glimpse into the sprinting capacities of the pro peloton. Often the maximum produced peak power is looked at. Power equals the delivered energy in a certain time frame and is expressed in Watts. The shorter this time frame is chosen, the larger the power output, or the so-called peak power. Because a sprint can last up to 20 seconds, the delivered peak power over 1 second is not very meaningful. However, the peak power can say something about the acceleration and this is very important in sprinting. To dive deeper into this, we first have to look at which resistances have to be overcome in sprinting.\nWhich resistances work on a cyclist?\nThe sum of all forces acting on a sprinter equals the mass of the sprinter (plus the bike) times the acceleration. This is nothing other than Newton’s second law and you can always impress your audience with it at drinks and dinner parties. It follows that it takes more power to give something heavy the same acceleration as something light. The forces that play a role in a sprint are firstly the force that the sprinter delivers on the pedals and then the opposing forces: air resistance, the rolling resistance, and, when the road goes up, gravity. When the force delivered by the sprinter is greater than the counteracting forces, the sprinter continues to accelerate. When the sprinter delivers exactly the same amount of force as the other forces working against him or her, he or she will keep cycling at a constant speed.\nWhat is the most important resistance?\nGravity is a constant counteracting force depending on the weight of the cyclist. As far as rolling resistance is concerned, a lighter cyclist also has an advantage and it matters what kind of tires you have fitted and, of course, the tire pressure. But by far the most important counteracting force is the air resistance, at least on the flat, and that is where most sprints are decided.\nWhat is the effect of frontal surface and drag?\nThe harder you go, the more air resistance you have to overcome. Two factors are particularly important here, and that is the size of the frontal surface and the so-called drag coefficient. With a small frontal surface you need to move less air when you want to go through it and the drag is smaller. The drag coefficient is a measure of the extent to which the displaced air ‘sticks’ to the cyclist. Closely related to this is the turbulence or ‘wake’ that occurs behind the cyclist, ideally it is as small as possible.\nWhat are good power numbers in a cycling sprint?\nTo give an insight in how these resistances and power relate to each other, we take the data of an ‘unknown’ sprinter who wins the bunch sprint of a Grand Tour stage. These data are from a study that does not want to reveal the name of the sprinter. The peak power of this sprinter was only 1097 W. On the other hand, he managed an average of 926 W for 14 seconds, after a ride of more than five and a half hours during which the last three minutes he had to deliver an average of 490 Watt to keep up with the pace and in the last 64 seconds even delivered more than 600 Watt. That’s quite impressive. In these 14 seconds the sprinter managed to accelerate from 58.5 km/h to 65 km/h. The power output of 926 Watt can be split up in rolling resistance (54 W or 6%), air resistance (688 W or 74%) and acceleration (184 W or 20%). This shows how important it is to sprint as aerodynamically as possible. Think of Mark Cavendish, who often seems to touch his front wheel with the tip of his nose!\nWhat is better; sitting or standing sprinting?\nResearch has shown that sprinting out of the saddle can increase the power output by 8 %-12 %. However, the frontal surface area and thus the air resistance also increase. At really high speeds the increase in the available power can therefore sometimes be less than the increase in air resistance, so it’s better to sit down again quickly. Track sprinters that regularly reach 80 km/h, often sit down again quickly after their initial acceleration. The extra power released during standing sprints comes from the upper body, which is transferred over the hip joint. This indicates that for sprinting the upper body should be well trained. This is in line with the observation that track sprinters are generally very muscly guys. However, in road cycling you often first have to overcome 200 km over hilly terrain, where you don’t want to carry this extra muscle mass. That’s why professional cyclists are actually all well-trained endurance athletes.\nWhich muscle fiber types do you need in a sprint?\nBesides aerodynamics, success in a sprint is largely determined by muscle volume and muscle fiber type. Research has shown that thigh size can explain 70 % of the variation in peak power of different cyclists. It is therefore worthwhile to keep a close eye for the size of your competitor’s thighs. In addition, the distribution in muscle fiber type is important. Two muscle fiber types can be distinguished: the slow-twitch, type-I fiber and the fast-twitch, type-II fiber.\nThe main distinction between these types of fibers is that type-I fibers have a lower optimal contraction rate and produce less power than type-II fibers. On the other hand, type-I fibers can sustain an effort much longer. Type-I fibers have a higher blood flow and are rich in glycogen and aerobic enzymes. These fibers produce relatively less power, but can keep that production up for a long time by aerobic combustion. Type-II fibers work mainly on anaerobic energy, so without the presence of oxygen. But the formation of lactate that comes with anaerobic energy production causes these muscles to not be able to produce power for very long. But they can contract up to 5 times more vigorously (per muscle mass unit), delivering much higher peak power. It should be noted that through training, part of the type-II fiber can be turned into muscle fibers with mainly type-I properties. However, there is also a part that cannot be ‘tuned’ by training, and the extent to which you have these powerful fibers is innate. In sprinting, therefore, genetics play a big role.\nWhat is the ideal cadence and crank length in a sprint?\nThe extent to which you have both types of muscle fibers and the distribution of type of muscle fibers determines the optimum pedal speed to produce as much power as possible. This pedal speed is determined by the crank length and the pedaling frequency (cadence). Someone with mainly type-II fibers has a preference for a higher contraction speed and thus a higher pedal speed than someone with a lot of type-I fibers. Research with track sprinters has found that on average most power is produced at 120 to 140 revolutions per minute. For more endurance-trained athletes this number will be somewhat lower, but it is important to note that the chosen bicycle gearing must allow the cadence to reach at least 110 to 120 rpm. If you choose too heavy a gearing, the powerful type-II fibers will not be able to use their full power. Research has shown that crank length makes little difference in the maximum peak power produced. There are no significant differences in peak power between the commercially available crank lengths (from 165mm to 180mm).\nWhat is the effect of good positioning in a sprint?\nBut the most important factor in sprinting on the road turns out to be positioning. As explained earlier, by far the biggest resistance to overcome is air resistance. By positioning behind a teammate or competitor this resistance can be reduced by up to 25%. The point is of course that when you start from someone’s wheel you have to overcome two more meters. If you come from the tenth position you have to deal with terrible slow sprinters if you want to have some chance of winning. A mathematical model was developed that uses two sprinters that can both produce exactly the same amount of power as the professional cyclist in the example above. The sprinter that starts from the wheel will overtake the sprinter in front within 8 seconds and eventually win with 1.05 meters difference over a sprint distance of 236 meters. The sprinter who starts the sprint in third place will have to settle for third place with the same amount of power.\nSprinting is a complex affair. An important factor that determines the success in sprinting is the aerodynamic resistance that has to be overcome. In addition, issues such as standing or sitting sprinting, pedaling frequency, muscle mass, muscle fiber type and especially positioning play an important role. Finally, a very important tip: continue sprinting until the finish line. You don’t want to become the next YouTube or Twitter celebrity that is ridiculed for celebrating a race win just a little bit too early."

    "content": "In case of indoor training the “ERG mode” is often mentioned, but what is it exactly and why can it be helpful for your indoor training sessions? In this article, we’ll explain to you the basics of this mode and we’ll also give you some helpful tips to keep in mind during a workout in the ERG mode.\nTrain specific on your indoor trainer\nYour indoor trainer is not only useful foor indoor training on bad weather days or a helpful tool for pro riders while waiting for a broken collar bone to heal. The value of your indoor trainer also lies in the endless possibilities to train exactly according to the right levels. In human performance physiology we call this specificity and it is the cornerstone of training. It comes down to this: if you want to become a better cyclist, just focus on riding your bike and your training goal. Sounds easy, but interestingly enough most people never really break down their training goal into the various ingredients.\nTrain at constant power\nLet’s break down the training goal for a cyclosportive event like, for example, La Marmotte. What you need there is strength to ride up steep climbs, great endurance stamina to ride your bike for about 9 hours (or even longer), a high aerobic threshold so you can ride at a high pace (at an intensity at which your body still relies on burning mostly fat) and, last but not least, a high FTP. If we focus on the latter and try to improve your FTP, you can achieve this by executing steady intervals on your Functional Threshold Power. If you try to do this outdoors, you will probably notice how hard it is to keep your power output constant because the environment constantly changes. You will end up in traffic, have to deal with turns and traffic lights and with wind that suddenly blows from another direction. Or you find yourself on hills that don’t have a steady gradient.\nCheck the cadence\nTo train at exactly the right intensity for an exact amount of time, the ERG mode setting is your best friend. All you need is a smart trainer and an app that can activate this mode. It lets you train on a specific target power. Your indoor trainer will subsequently keep you on that same target power regardless of your speed or cadence. Every change in your cadence is automatically adjusted by your trainer by applying more or less resistance to keep your power output constant. So, if you set the ERG mode at 200 watts, your trainer delivers more resistance at a low cadence and less resistance at a high cadence to keep your power at 200 watts. For this workout it is key to control your cadence and keep it at a desired rpm to avoid putting too much strain on your muscles. But, as with all things in life, you will never keep your cadence constant on the exact desired rpm. Therefore, the power output will show minor variations.\n6 tips for indoor training in ERG mode\n\nFirst and foremost, keep your eyes on your cadence and not on your power. You only have control over your cadence so keep it at a desired number and keep it steady.\nWhen your cadence drops it takes a lot of strength to get it back up again. Also, with a low cadence the force per pedal stroke and therefore the muscle strain is higher. If this isn’t your training goal, don’t let your cadence slip.\nThere is a small delay in the cadence you adopt and the corresponding resistance that is set by your smart trainer. If you change your cadence every second it will be nearly impossible for your smart trainer to keep track and adjust the resistance level. So, aim for a steady cadence without big swings.\nERG mode doesn’t teach you to use your gears properly, which is also an essential task in riding your bicycle. So, use ERG mode for the right specific training sessions and don’t ride all your workouts in the ERG mode if you’re training for La Marmotte.\nTraining in ERG mode is mentally a lot easier than when you have to pace yourself. ERG mode is like a team time trial in which you are not the best rider. It means that someone else is setting the tempo and you basically just follow. This is exactly what you need after a long exhausting day at the office, but also try to do some high intensity intervals with the ERG mode disabled whenever you feel you are up for it.\nYour body is not a machine. Some days you easily hit the targeted numbers and other days even the warm up feels like someone has put the brakes on your rear wheel. ERG mode doesn’t know how you feel, it just keeps on time trialing. So, if you feel you can’t handle the intensity, use your common sense and trim the power a little to avoid crushing yourself."

    "content": "In the cold winter months many cyclists concentrate on long endurance rides. However, many of them have no idea why they are doing such long training rides. The general idea is that in the winter a foundation has to be built for the rest of the season. The comparison with building a house, where first the foundations have to be laid, is then often made. Is HIT training usefull for cycling? Is your body actually comparable to building a house?\nHow to build up the intensity of your workouts\nIt is wise to build up the level of the workouts cautiously after a rest period. This level is not only determined by the duration of a training, but also by its intensity. A short interval training can be just as stressful for the body as a long endurance training. The question is now why most people prefer long endurance training and sometimes even claim that interval training during the build-up period is bad. Can you only build your stamina with long endurance rides?\nThe effect of the intensity of a workout\nThe short answer is no and it also has to do with the bike goals you are working towards. Slowly building up means that you give your body enough time and rest to recover. This relates to the load of the training and not only to either the intensity or the duration of the training. An enormously long and low intensity workout can also be too heavy for a body that has not done a lot of training yet. In addition, cycling does not only consist of extremely aerobic endurance and if you want to get better, it is wise to also train the anaerobic system from time to time during the winter months.\n\n\nKeep training in higher zones\n\n\nIn fact, if you’ve improved a whole season in the higher zones and Watts, for example on sprints and short climbs, then it’s very unwise to ignore this for months. Precisely this fitness then disappears in the blink of an eye. Research has found that if you continue to mix endurance and HIIT (high intensity interval training) training sessions in the winter months, you will progress more than those who only do endurance rides.\nDifferent HIT workouts\n\n\nSo continue to train in a varied way during the winter months, including a HIT training at least once a week. Read more about this in the article: Train like a pro: polarized training. This doesn’t always have to be in the form of specific Vo2max blocks, but it can also be a ride on the MTB with some hard sections or a Zwift race. Be careful, however, that after a period of rest you don’t immediately set the number of hours and intensity too high, but build this up slowly.\nVaried training or specific repetition\n\n\nResearch has also shown that high level athletes need to train specifically on a certain aspect if they still want to make progress. Simply put, a highly trained athlete will not improve with a weekly program with many different training stimuli. This way, every element is trained a little bit but these stimuli are too weak to provoke improvements. That’s why it is wise, after a number of varied weeks and depending on your level, to shift the emphasis a bit and focus on those elements that need improving towards the target race or event.\nA proper build-up\n\nFor highly trained riders, after a (short) rest period we start with a number of varied weeks in which the size and intensity slowly build up. Depending on what we want to improve over the winter, a number of weeks will follow with a focus on, for example, maximum strength training without a lot of endurance work. With good planning we try to take a step forward in the winter so that all physical requirements coincide exactly like pieces of a puzzle when the season starts."

    "content": "Training alone doesn’t make you a better cyclist. You only make progress when you give your body time to recover from training. And when you administer the next training stimulus at the right moment, you really start going places. Even after a relatively short season, sometimes you don’t feel like training anymore and you’d rather lie on the couch than jump on your bike. Of course, it’s always good to be mentally refreshed and feel like training again. However, a nasty consequence is that your condition will disappear like snow in the sun. The question is how quickly this stamina disappears and how long can you rest without starting from scratch again?\n\nWhat happens after one week of inactivity.\n\n\nAfter a week of inactivity, the first signs of decline appear. The first three to six days, however, nothing is wrong yet. That’s good news for the riders who already get nervous when they ‘have to’ go away for a weekend and can’t train. It also means you can give yourself time to recover after a fall or a severe cold.\nAfter a week of inactivity, your blood volume starts to decrease. That means your heart can’t pump as much blood around. Furthermore, the efficiency of your muscles deteriorates, which means that they are more acidified during intensive efforts. So it’s time to train again!\nWhat happens after two weeks\n\n\nIf you don’t do anything for a week, you can limit the damage. However, sitting on the couch for another week drastically reduces the condition. The maximum oxygen uptake decreases by 4 to 6%, the blood volume decreases even further by as much as 15%. As a result, you notice that the heart rate rises during exercise and, strikingly enough, the maximum heart rate also rises by up to 10 beats per minute. Furthermore, the beating volume, i.e. the amount of blood that the heart can pump per beat, drops  and the body becomes less efficient. The capilization (amount of small blood vessels in the muscles) decreases, so that blood and therefore oxygen and nutrients are less able to reach the muscles. The mitochondria (the energy factories in the muscles) also work less efficiently. Muscles are less able to burn fats and therefore have to rely more on carbohydrate combustion. In addition, the carbohydrate supply in the muscles decreases. A double problem.\nResult: a decrease in the endurance condition. All these factors result in a worsening of the condition. This decrease lies between 7 and 10%, depending on things like training and talent. A rider who can deliver 330 Watt in shape for an hour, will after two weeks of doing nothing  still be able to pedal a small 310 Watt.\nWhat happens after four weeks\nAfter four weeks of inactivity, all previously described processes decrease even further. The VO2max in a trained endurance athlete will have decreased by an average of 15 to 20%. It will therefore take even longer to regain the old form. Not only do the mitochondria now work less well, but the number of mitochondria has also decreased. After two weeks of not training, you can get back to your old level with three to four structured training weeks, while after a month of rest it’s ten to twelve weeks.\n\nWhat is striking is that the endurance condition in particular is rapidly decreasing, while the decrease in anaerobic capacity is much smaller. After two to three weeks of inactivity you also start to lose muscle mass, but this is less of an effect than the loss of the aerobic condition. This means that after a period of rest, you can still provide a lot of strength and go deep. Above all, you notice that you can’t make such intensive efforts often in a row and it takes a long time before you recover.\n\nContinuity is the key\nOf course it is impossible to keep training for a whole year and you need to change your focus every once in a while. This is the only way to stay motivated and enter a new training period with dedication. However, the trick is not to sit still for too long. That doesn’t mean that you have to train at full capacity again, but that you have to reduce the volume of the training for a period of time. By keeping busy three times a week for a short period of time, but with a relatively high intensity, you can maintain your condition for a long time.\nKeeping continuity has a lot to do with setting goals. Our application EnduroCo Cycling can help you with selecting an appropriate goal and following a training plan. Our training plans adapt to your available time, goals and training history. It’s like having a pro cycling coach for a fraction of the costs."

    "content": "Which strength training will make you ride faster?\nAs a cyclist, do you benefit from strength training and if so, which strength training exactly? This article discusses if strength training can contribute to a better cycling performance. The overview at the end of the article can help you select the best method for you.\nWhy do you need strength for an endurance sport like cycling?\nCycling is an endurance sport. During training sessions or races long distances are covered, where the average power is relatively low. The aerobic energy system in particular is trained. After a period of training, the capillarity (number of small blood vessels) increases and so does the exchange of oxygen, from blood vessels to muscle. Because the muscles have more oxygen at their disposal, they are able to burn more fats and carbohydrates and thus supply more energy. Strength training increases muscle volume, which hampers the exchange of oxygen between blood vessels and muscles. You could therefore say that intensive strength training goes at the expense of endurance. In addition, an increase in muscle volume results in a higher weight, which is the last thing a cyclist wants.\nMost decisive moments in a race require strength.\nHowever, cycling nowadays is much more than only an endurance sport. Races are often decided in a sprint or with a fierce demarrage. Components in which you can excel if you have a decent amount of power. However, strength can also be a limiting factor when riding a long time trial or climb. So strength training definitely makes a meaningful contribution to cycling performance, but the danger lies in the fact that strength training can limit aerobic fitness and increase weight. You can still be such a strong sprinter, but you still have to climb all those mountains to get to Paris and win the sprint on the Champs-Elysées. Searching for the right shape and fine tuning the strength training is therefore crucial for a cyclist.\nWhat muscle fibers does a cyclist need to train?\nThe human body contains 3 different types of muscle fiber: slow (type-I), fast (type-IIA) and very fast (type-IIB). The type-I fibers can deliver little strength, but can sustain this for a very long time, while the type-IIB fibers can deliver a lot of strength, but can sustain this for a short time. Every human being is born with different proportions of these muscle fibers. For example, sprinters naturally have a lot of type II-B fibers, while endurance athletes naturally have a lot more type-I fibers.\nBy doing a lot of endurance training, especially the type-IIA, but also the type IIB fibers, can be tuned to type-I fibers. In other words, endurance training makes you limper. To date, no convincing scientific evidence has provided the opposite, the tuning of slow to fast fibers. In order to make the different muscle fiber types stronger, they will also have to be trained in different ways, bearing in mind that improving the properties of one type of fiber may go at the expense of the other. Before a rider starts strength training, he should therefore think carefully about the purpose for this strength training and how his own body is made up.\nWhat strength training can you do for different muscle fiber types?\nType-IIB\nThese fibers have the property that they can deliver a lot of power, but not for very long. They are mostly used at sprints and short demarrages. Strength training has a lot of effect on this type of muscle fibers. The muscles can deliver much more strength and increase in size (hypertrophy). The downside of this is a negative effect on endurance and a considerable weight gain. A sprinter who wants to survive a hill will therefore have to be careful with this form of strength training.\nTo make the type-IIB fibers stronger you will have to perform exercises of 3-8 repetitions with as much weight as possible. This requires a lot of strength as well as neuromuscular control. It is therefore impossible to start with this form of strength training immediately, because the strain on tendons and joints can be too high. In addition, the muscles will not be able to cope with such a high load from one day to the next and the chance of muscle damage is also very high.\nType-IIA\nThe other fast muscle fibers, the type-IIA fibers have not only fast but also slow muscle properties. This means that they can deliver less strength, but can keep this up for longer than type-IIB. It also means that these muscle fiber types are extremely trainable. After a period of endurance training, it is mainly these muscle fibers that acquire slow properties. The type-IIA fibers are mainly recruited during efforts at a sub-maximal level, around the tipping point. Think of efforts like a time trial, a long climb, or forcing a gap between the leading group and the peloton. After a period of strength training, this muscle fiber type becomes stronger and also increases in volume, albeit to a lesser extent than the type-IIB fibers. In order to increase the strength in the type-IIA fibers, the number of repetitions of an exercise will have to be between 12 and 18.\nType I\nFinally, the slow, type-I fibers. These fibers are used during prolonged efforts where the power is relatively low. They have little power and provide little energy, but are capable of sustaining an effort for a very long time. Nevertheless, these muscle fibers can also benefit from strength training and become stronger. Strong slow muscle fibers can make all the difference, especially when climbing for long periods of time. Slow muscle fibers can deliver optimum power at around 80 RPM, because the contraction rate of type-I fibers is much slower than that of fast muscle fibers. When riding long climbs, the peak force per pedal stroke becomes so high that the fast muscle fibers will have to be used. By strengthening the slow muscle fibers, they are able to keep supplying energy during climbing, so that the fast muscle fibers can be spared. In order to strengthen the slow muscle fibers, a lot of repetitions will have to be chosen, which means between 20 and 30. But strength training outdoors on a bicycle by riding uphill with a low cadence and high power also works very well to make these muscle fibers stronger.\nWhich strength training is right for you?\nStrength training can make a positive contribution to your cycling performance. However, it is important to choose the right form of strength training, taking into account the characteristics that need to be improved. Depending on what you want to improve you choose the right exercises and the right number of repetitions. The question of whether you can do the exercises with your own weight at home or whether you need a squat rack at the gym also depends on this question. The strength training will have to be as specific as possible. This is precisely why when improving Type-I muscle fibers, strength training on a bicycle is preferable. The muscle groups that are strengthened should be the same and should be trained as much as possible in the same way as on a bicycle.\nThe best strenght training exercises\nThe best strenght training exercises at home or in the gym are the squat and step-up. Training with free weights is always preferable to fixed weights, as several muscle groups that take care of coordination and balance are also put to work. Simultaneous training of your core stability is essential. As the beautiful English expression goes: “You can’t fire a cannon from a canoe”. So avoid exercises like the leg-press. After a period of strength training there is not only an increase in strength, but also a change in the coordination pattern on the bike. Whatever you do, never start strength training too fanatically, but first make sure that you have fully mastered the technique behind the exercises. Then build up the resistance carefully.\nStudy to strenght training cyclists\nBelow is a brief overview of various studies for cyclists into different forms of strength training and the degree of improvement in different areas. Maybe this can help you to do the right strength training this winter.\n\n\n\nStudy\nSubjects\nMethod\nResearch\nResult\n\n\nR.C.

    "content": "The saying goes that only women and red wine improve with age. But also Alejandro Valverde was riding the 2021 Tour de France again like a young racehorse, even though he is in his forties! Despite the increasing number of new, upcoming stars like Remco Evenepoel and Quinn Simmons, there are quite a few pro cyclists who are still doing well at relatively old age. Think for example of Chris Horner, who won the Tour of Spain in 2012 at the age of forty-one. But why shouldn’t you be able to compete at the front of the peloton at an older age? Maybe there are also advantages to getting older within cycling. But let’s start with the bad news.\nThe loss of muscle mass while you get older\n\n\nAs you get older, you lose muscle mass (both the volume and the number of fibers decrease significantly). The muscles also lose their ability to extract oxygen from the blood. This is mainly due to a decrease in the mitochondria and their functioning. In addition, the immune system also has to deal with the aging process, which on average amounts to a decrease of 2-3% per year from the age of 20. This is mainly due to a decrease in the production of white blood cells and T-cells, as a result of which disease and infection will occur more often and faster. Genetics, nutrition, lifestyle and the degree of physical activity all determine the course of the aging process. Research shows that physical activity at a later age can slow down these processes and even postpone them completely! However, it is of course a process that eventually will occur anyway.\nYou need more strength training the older you get\n\n\nThe most important thing to do as the age increases is to add strength training and HIT training to the training regime. From an untrained status you have to start with just easy rides, because you will get enough training effect from this. In addition, endurance rides always remain the basis of an aerobic sport such as cycling. But once you have passed the untrained stage, it is smart to add high intensity training (HIT) and strength training to the easy rides. These HIT training sessions increase the mitochondrial capacity by 49% in young people, but even by 69% in older people.\nThe advantages of getting older\n\n\nThere are also advantages with the increase in age, so that Valverde, for example, still manages to keep up with the peloton. Experience is one: as simple as it is difficult to grasp. There are various forms of experience. It’s the tactical experience of following the right demarrage in a race or not completely blowing yourself up on the first climb of a cyclo. Also the experience which training regime or feeding schedule works out the best for you. But perhaps the most important is the experience at the mental level. In cycling, it’s not uncommon to find that the older guys are the best at dealing with exploding legs and lactate levels up to their eyeballs.\nDoes your pain tolerance go up with the years?\n\n\nOf course, it is difficult to measure who is suffering the most pain, but there are studies that have measured the relationship between how hard someone indicates that an exercise is feeling and what percentage of his or her Vo2max he or she is pushing at the same time. These studies show that pros give a lower ‘pain number’ at a high percentage of their Vo2max than amateurs or younger cyclists. On a scale of 6 to 20, for example, pros report a 16 at an average of 89% of their Vo2max, while amateurs and young cyclists at the 16-level were found to push 81% and 83% of their Vo2max respectively.\nExperience is key\n\n\nPros and more experienced riders probably have better coping strategies with high intensity cycling, making it feel less heavy. You could argue that pros are pros because they have a higher pain tolerance for starters anyway. Studies show that mental strategies work in coping with pain, so you can keep going a little longer. Mental techniques such as dissociation, disconnecting feeling and situation, and distraction (looking for distraction in other things than the pain in our legs), can be developed by consciously applying them regularly and thus gaining experience. Other techniques like positive self-talk can also help. For example, converting the experience into positive self-talk, that the pain is only temporary and of short duration (and that the glory is forever!). This can make the difference, and help the older cyclists beat the younger ones."

    "content": "Cramp during cycling is one of the most mysterious phenomena in exercise physiology. One person has never had to deal with it, while to the next it seems to be the eternal nemesis. What exactly is cramp and, more importantly, what can you do about it?\nWhat are cramps?\nCramp is an involuntary muscle contraction. Without being told to, the muscle contracts, often at maximum intensity, making it impossible to continue cycling (or running). Cramps can occur at several places in the body, but with cycling it is usually the thighs or calves that suffer. Apart from possible medical causes of cramp, such as kidney failure or pregnancy, there is actually not one specific cause for cramp. So it is not that the exercise physiology science is still in the dark as is sometimes claimed. It’s just that the one specific trigger for cramp does not exist, nor one magic cure that always solves it. Below we list the three most common causes for cramp that unfortunately, to complicate matters further, also seem to interact!\nThe 3 causes of cramps\n\nOveruse of the muscles. Cramps due to exercise never occur during your recovery ride with your hands on top of the handlebars. Therefore, the first and most important cause is a simple one: if you have ridden for too long and too intensively, cramps may be lurking. As a result of the effort, the muscles are no longer properly supplied with nutrients to be able to function normally. Cramps may well be the result.\nA disturbed fluid balance. Without water, everything process in the body eventually stops. The body consists of 55% water; it is the building block of all tissues. In addition, it ensures that the transportation of nutrients can take place. Water contains minerals, also called electrolytes. Magnesium, potassium, sodium and calcium, for example, are minerals that are essential to normal muscle function. These minerals ensure that the sodium-potassium pump in the muscles can continue to do its work, causing the muscles to contract. In case of a disturbed fluid balance due to too much loss of fluid and therefore also loss of minerals, it is precisely this lack that can contribute to the development of cramps.\nReduced blood flow. When less blood reaches the muscles and the supply of nutrients is thereby compromised, cramps can also occur. A reduced blood supply can be caused by a pinched blood vessel, but also by vasoconstriction, the narrowing of the blood vessels in very cold weather, for example. Most often, however, a cyclist’s blood supply is reduced due to dehydration in very hot weather.\n\nThe question is now, of course, how you can weapon yourself against cramps. Again, there is not one solution that will always make the difference, but rather a combination of them.\n\n\nBuy a power meter and know where your limits are. Sometimes it can be as simple as that.\nKeep drinking during your ride. In warm weather, try to drink at least 500 ml of isotonic sports drink per hour. Preferably not plain water, but add some carbohydrates (10-30 grams) plus some electrolytes. These days, there is ample choice in electrolyte tabs that provide a good balance of various electrolytes to spice up the water bottle.\nKeep eating well on your ride. On demanding rides that last longer than 2 hours, you should consume at least 60 grams of carbohydrates per hour. Preferably even 90 grams per hour (only manageable if those carbs are served in a glucose:fructose ratio of 2:1, but that’s actually next level pro stuff that also requires some training to get used to).\nExtra electrolytes. Some people swear by magnesium pills for example, but a banana (full of potassium!) can work wonders as well. As literature shows, a tablet of magnesium is not really the cure-all. But the combination of the banana, the magnesium tablet and the electrolytes in the bidon will all help.\nBe careful with alcohol and coffee. Alcohol has a considerable diuretic effect on the body. A lot of alcohol the evening before the race is never a good idea for many reasons, but it also leaves you with a disturbed fluid balance. Coffee, although with a smaller impact than alcohol, also has a diuretic effect on the body. A lot of coffee before the start is best avoided, if only to prevent that you need to stop for a pee frequently in the early part of the ride.\nAcclimatize. The human body is incredibly capable of adapting to warm conditions. Unfortunately it does take 7 to 10 days to become optimally acclimatized, but even in 4 to 6 days big differences can be observed. It has been shown that acclimatized athletes lose less moisture and thereby also less minerals. So a few days extra before D-day to get used to higher temperatures also helps to prevent cramping.\nA good bike position. A bad position may cause wrong or excessive use of certain muscle groups, but it may also restrict the blood supply. The right bicycle position can address this to ensure good blood flows."

    "content": "A busy job, your relationship or marriage with a nice women or man, challenging social live and, top of it all, a set of children and perhaps a dog. All of this usually leads to less time to train and more stress. What is the best way to deal with this? In other words, how can you train efficiently and effectively? Here are our 8 tips!\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe 8 golden tips for cyclists with little time.\n\nTrain harder. The load of a training and thus the impact of the training stimulus is determined by the duration and intensity. If you have less time and the training duration goes down, you should simply increase the intensity. Does this mean that instead of four hours of quiet endurance training you go hard for two hours? No! In these four hours you will mainly burn fat, while in the more intense two hours you will burn mostly carbohydrates. So you are training a different energy system and therefore the effect of the training will be different. The point is that by increasing the intensity because you have less time, you cannot expect that the training effect to be the same. What simply doesn’t make sense is doing very short endurance rides. Precisely the effectiveness of endurance training lies in, you guessed it, the duration of the training.\nAdjust your goals. You can’t expect that you can prepare well for long distances with only shorter training sessions. So adjust your goals and try to shift the focus. Use this period to improve, for example, on your 5 minute values or the sprint.\nTrain varied. You can quite simply state that if you have unlimited time to train it is less important to know exactly what you are doing. In fact, you train all areas a little and by simply making a lot of hours you will always improve. If you don’t have that time, you have to be smarter about it. It is more important to know when your last FTP or VO2max training was done and when you should schedule the next one, depending on your goals. In addition, it is important to keep training all your energy systems. A power meter is the best and easiest tool to monitor the intensity levels associated with these various energy systems.\nTrain specifically. If you don’t have a lot of time to train and your goals are to cycle better or faster, then train mainly on a bike. Strength training in the gym or other workouts can be very effective, but still try to be on your bike for at least 6 to 8 hours a week. If you have less time available, spend it on the bike (outdoor or indoor) and not under a barbell bar.\nDivide your time. For example, if you only have 3 hours a week to train, then try to plan three training sessions of one hour, rather than only one ride of 3 hours. With 6 days between training sessions, you will not improve your stamina. This period in between sessions is so long that the training effect and super compensation of the previous stimulus are already gone when the new training stimulus is presented.\nCall the other parents of the soccer team or haggle with the missus, but try to schedule that long easy endurance training at least once every 2 to 3 weeks. If you only train briefly and intensively, you will eventually miss out on the effect of a long, steady training ride. Even if you manage to do that long endurance ride just once a month, you will still notice that it contributes to your training progress.\nBuy an indoor trainer. For today’s cyclist, an indoor trainer is the best invention since sliced bread. Not only can you train on dark evenings, while the rain is lashing against the windows. You can also train at a very high intensity without having to look out for other road users. Better still, with programmes like Zwift you can also have a great time with other riders, albeit mostly virtually.\nTrain well-rested. Training with a tired body makes no sense. It doesn’t bring you anything. You can sometimes climb on your bike feeling like a zombie, but then after five minutes you start to feel alive again. But forcing yourself on the indoor bike three times a week at ten o’clock in the evening feeling really tired is useless. In situations like that, go back to step 2: adjust your goals and train less, but in a fitter state.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tConsistency is the key to succes\nIt’s important to keep balance with your personal live and goals on the bike. Training one week for ten hours and the next week for only two doesn’t make you a better cyclist. Try to keep your availability structured week in week out. That’s why Laurens ten Dam, Stefan Bolt and Jim van den Berg talk about this topic in the Beter Worden Podcast. Why you have to keep on training, when it’s a good idea to take some rest and how to keep cycling fun. All this and much more in this new episode of the Beter Worden podcast presented by Live Slow Ride Fast."

Let’s look at it from the scientific point of view: what is actually happening during a warming-up and should you include it in your cycling plans?\nOxygen uptake is better at a higher body temperature\nFirst of all, in the first part of a training session, the body temperature rises and the blood circulation accelerates. At a slightly higher body temperature, oxygen absorption improves, and thereby also the oxygen transport molecules in your blood, called hemoglobin. By warming up, more oxygen can therefore reach the muscles. Also, at a higher body temperature, the range of movement of your joints increases. A warmed-up body is slightly more flexible/less stiff.\nDon’t start with an oxygen debt.\nAnother factor that helps to perform better after a warm-up is the fact that when you start exercising with a higher intensity, the energy supply switches from fat burning to mainly carbohydrate burning. This process triggers an increase in the lactate level and is partly anaerobic. This means that there will be an oxygen debt for a short while until a new, stable state is reached. You don’t want this oxygen debt to arise in the first minutes of your time trial or race. Maybe you have experienced this in the first minutes of a race without warming-up, where you feel really exhausted only a few minutes in. If you make this switch during a gradual warming-up, you can put the hammer down right from the gun without feeling very tired very quickly.\nThe effect of neuro-muscular activation.\nThe neuro-muscular activation of the muscles also helps them to perform better after a warm-up. This process is called post-activation potentiation (PAP). It basically means that short bouts of intense physical activity cause a biomechanical change in the muscle cells, which increases the strength of the muscles. This effect lasts only about five to ten minutes. Thus, a muscle that has already made a considerable effort is markedly stronger in the five to ten minutes after that than a muscle that makes this effort for the first time. You may have noticed that your second or third sprint in a workout is always better than the first. This is partly explained by PAP.\nGetting the right mindset.\nLast but certainly not least is the effect of getting into the zone. A warm-up can help you get into the right mindset with the right amount of awareness/focus to perform optimally. That’s why you often see professional cyclists warm up while wearing big sunglasses, caps and headphones, to be completely locked out from the outside world to fully focus on the job at hand.\nHow to do a proper warming-up.\nNow that we have listed the positive effects of a warm-up, it is clear when it is necessary. It is logical that this not only applies to time trials, but to any event that will force you to go full throttle right from start. You could even argue that you should warm up with every effort. It can’t hurt to do it, right? While a warmed up muscle does indeed perform better, it is also still an effort. So don’t overdo it! Warming up for too long or too intensively can be counterproductive.\nYou also have a limited storage of carbohydrates in your body for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours at FTP-intensity. Emptying this storage during a warm-up ahead of an event lasting more than one hour will affect your performance. In fact, you can say that for efforts longer than an hour and a half or efforts that don’t require a hard start, it’s better to keep a warm-up to a minimum. In those cases, just a five to ten minutes warm up just before the start is already sufficient. A warm-up is also pointless if after it you will be standing still for 20 minutes, lined up in the starting grid and waiting for the gun. Save yourself the trouble in that case!"

    "content": "Recovery from day to day is often a challenge for many cyclists. Not only for a pro rider in the Tour de France, but also for the amateur cyclist who is riding several days back to back while clocking up a solid number of kilometers and a few famous cols during events like Transalp or the Grand traverse of the Alps. Although from day to day every cyclist will inevitably perform a bit less, the trick is to keep this decline to a minimum. This recovery actually starts on the bike with a proper distribution of your energy and a good nutritional strategy, but in this article we’ll also go into the do’s and don’ts between getting off the bike and hitting the sack.\nRead on or watch the video.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#1 Hydration\nAlthough for most cyclists priority number one is uploading their ride to Strava, it should actually be hydrating. Also, it’s not the proteins that should come first, but hydration, then the carbohydrates and finally the proteins. The longer and heavier the ride, the more important it is to replenish the proteins. For carbohydrates and proteins there is a window in the first hour in which you can absorb these especially easily. That’s why pros always get handed a water bottle with these proteins and carbohydrates right after the finish, which is usually drunk right after the first coke. This so-called recovery bottle usually contains 20-25 grams of whey protein, which is a smaller protein that is absorbed faster than the casein protein in dairy, plus ~50 grams of carbohydrates. These drinks also often contain more salts to make up for deficiencies in the electrolytes area.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#2 Recovery ride\nIt’s certainly advisable to do a short recovery ride. You were often seen as the village idiot when you got on the indoor trainer after a tough stage. Nowadays it is completely the opposite, you can see cycling teams making an extra few kilometers on the trainer next to the team bus immediately after the finish. Often 10 minutes is enough to turn on the sodium-potassium pump of your muscles and thus actively dispose of all waste products. The trick is to let the pedals spin with a minimum of effort. Although most cyclists prefer to lie on the massage table instead of cycling for another 10 minutes, there are even teams where you are not allowed on the massage table until after you have done a recovery ride. If your ride doesn’t end in a bunch sprint, you can of course do this in the last few kilometers of the ride, instead of on the trainer.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#3 Massage\nThe massage is one of the most controversial recovery techniques in cycling. Simply put, the scientific evidence for the healing power of the massage is wafer thin. However, very few cyclists prefer to do nothing more than crawl on the massage table after an exhausting day in the saddle. The role of the soigneur actually goes a bit further than just his work as a masseur. Usually the massage is one of the few points of rest during the day and the therapist is also a mental carer. The attributed effect of the massage will partly be related to this, but a good masseur also knows how to reduce muscle tension and thus stimulate natural muscle recovery.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#4 Lie down\nOne of the ancient laws in cycling says that you should sit if you don’t need to stand and that you should lie down if you don’t need to sit. So don’t stand unnecessarily on your legs, like on a stroll through town. There are legendary stories of a Tour de France winner who ordered his teammates to carry him up 5 stairs to his hotel room to save his legs! A very short, light walk can provide some extra active muscle recovery for example after dinner. But you should really try to stay on your bed until you are called for dinner or a massage.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#5 Eat, eat, eat\nWhen you’re no longer hungry, then you should start worrying. All the carbohydrates you’ve consumed during a day’s riding need to be replenished. With an absorption capacity of 60 to 90 grams per hour, that’s often quite a trick to get done before going to bed and nigh on impossible with just one meal. There are therefore stories of pro cyclists who were woken up at night to wolf down another serving of pasta. Of course you also have to replenish the other macro-nutrients. So don’t think you can complete a Tour de France on just pasta or wine gums. Make sure you eat good quality foods with sufficient vegetables, proteins and vitamins while containing XL-sized carbohydrate portions.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#6 Protein\nExtra protein before going to bed is a great and proven method to work on muscle recovery during sleep. Another 25 grams of casein protein through the yogurt/soft cheese/cottage cheese or milk is therefore recommended.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#7 Cold water bath\nOne of the most barbaric recovery methods is a cold water bath. This works almost in the same way as a massage. The cold water causes the blood vessels to constrict, increasing the speed in the blood vessels and thereby the speed of waste products discharge. Pro athletes were taking them mostly after hard weight training sessions, but the habit has fallen a bit out of fashion recently.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#8 Recovery clothing\nLess barbaric but creating the same effect are recovery socks or compression clothing. These socks will most likely get you a ticket from the fashion police, but they do help to get the blood out of the legs and especially the calves faster. Especially at the dinner table or in the car or bus on the way to the hotel, these days the recovery socks are the rule rather than the exception in the pro peloton.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#9 Avoid alcohol\nGood news! Although it is imperative to avoid alcohol immediately after exercise and to ensure that carbohydrates, fluids and proteins are replenished first, a glass of wine at dinner can do little harm. Research has shown that alcohol hinders the protein synthesis in the muscles, but a small amount of alcohol will not do any harm in the short term. In the longer term the effects of alcohol on the immune system, the quality of sleep and muscle building are somewhat less positive, but just a glass of wine at dinner time is fine.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#10 Skip the sauna\nThere are no good cyclists from Finland yet. That could be because of their love for the sauna. It’s not good at all to sit in a Finnish sauna after a tough ride and lose even more fluids. Skip the sauna and go to bed with the recovery socks on.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t#11 Sleep\nGo to bed on time. As a famous Tour de France winner once said: you win the Tour de France in bed. Sleep is vital, so make sure of the quality of it. If you have a roommate who likes to read until late, unscrew the light next to his side of the bed when he’s taking a shower."

    "content": "Milan-San Remo is a special race on the cycling calendar. It is considered the official opening of the classic cycling season. Milan-San Remo is characterized by 300 quite flat and boring kilometers across the plains of the river Po, with all the wild action crammed into the last 30 kilometers. Thirty kilometers before the finish, two hills appear, first the Cipressa, followed by the Poggio. The summit of the Poggio is only 5 kilometers before the finish on the via Roma, which gives puncheurs/climbers a chance to outsmart a sprinter.\nHow to save the legs\nThis race requires the contenders to keep their gunpowder dry for many hours, while their teammates have to make sure that their target men spend as little energy as possible in the pack until the Poggio. Then it’s up to a sprinter to try and follow the pace of the puncheurs/climbers. Whether that succeeds depends on how fresh you still are when you get to the foot of the Poggio, or in other words to what extent the 290 kilometers have eaten away at the fitness already. Also for the attackers on the Poggio, it’s not about how fast you can ride up the Poggio, but how fast you can go after 290 kilometers. Often in cycling it’s not about how fast you can do something once, but how fast you can do it 20 times, or after 300 kilometers. The cyclist who deteriorates the least is often the one who ends up on the podium.\nThis is exactly why it is very misleading to only watch the FTP, the maximum power you can sustain for up to an hour, or a Power Profile (PP). A Power Profile indicates your best power over the whole range from 1 second to as much as 3 hours. Of course these values do say something about your qualities as a cyclist, but in many situations the PP gives a distorted picture.\nAerobic decoupling\nThere is a measure to get an idea of the degree of deterioration or how well the aerobic endurance is developed. This measure is called aerobic decoupling (AD). It very simply compares the relationship between heart rate and power over the first half of the workout with the second half of the workout. The difference between the first and second half is expressed as a percentage. A high percentage indicates that you had much higher heart rate in the second half of the workout at the same power levels and means that you body deteriorated markedly in the second half of the ride.\nWhat’s a good level of decoupling?\nIf you want to compare these aerobic decoupling numbers you have to take a few things into account. First of all, dehydration has a huge impact on it. A very high percentage can also indicate that you have had too little to drink or that the weather was very hot. The same is true for insufficient food. In addition, a training must be at least 2 hours long to be able to compare both halves. Finally, the first half should be comparable to the second half in terms of intensity distribution. If the intensity is completely different, then the ratio between them is also incomparable.\nSo, for example, if you want to see how the aerobic decoupling improves from week to week, compare two more or less similar training sessions, ridden in the same conditions and with the same training load in the days before. Your goal should be to get the decoupling below 5% for endurance training sessions of 2 to 4 hours. Step two will then be to achieve this decoupling over the 300 kilometers of Milan-San Remo, but by then you will most likely already competing in the pro peloton."

    "content": "Not that long ago most cyclists would make a U-turn when they suddenly hit upon a gravel road. Nowadays, the internet is searched for ‘undiscovered’ gravel paths and a gravel bike is part of the standard equipment of many cyclists. With the ultimate gravel race, the Strade Bianche in Tuscany, Italy, just around the corner, we zoom in on the ‘key elements’ of riding on gravel.\n\nGravel Race\nStrade Bianche, which literally translates as ‘white roads’, is a very young classic race with 13 editions to its name in 2019, and the 2020 edition will be number 14. Yet on its short list of winners you’ll see some very well-known names. Swiss hard man Fabian Cancellara won it three times and Poland’s Michal Kwiatkowski finished first twice. It’s also noticeable that many cyclo-cross riders have made it to the podium, like Wout van Aert. That a cyclo-cross rider like Van Aert or a cobbles specialist like Cancellara excel on the gravel paths around Siena is not surprising. Because riding cobblestones, cyclo-cross or gravel is different from racing on tarmac in a number of ways.\nRolling resistance on gravel\nFirst of all, the gravel surface provides greater rolling resistance. This means that at a constant power output, the amount of rolling resistance as part of the total resistance is higher on gravel than on asphalt. Assuming that the slope remains the same, this means that another resistance component, the aerodynamic one, plays a less important role. This means that the so-called ‘draft effect’ (the effect of reduced air resistance when you ride behind the rider in front of you) is also lower. In other words, a cyclist cannot “hide” and save energy as much as you can in a large peloton on tarmac, but has to rely on his own abilities more. Additionally, because of the increased rolling resistance, the speeds tend to be lower as well, which makes the air resistance even less of a factor and thereby the ‘draft effect’ even smaller still.\n\nIn addition on a gravel road there are often only one or two lines on the track that are good to ride on. That’s why a peloton on a gravel road often stretches out in a long ribbon. When you are too far at the back of the peloton, it is quite difficult to get back in the race (a long line of riders to overtake while the good lines on the gravel road are basically taken up by all those riders ahead). Good classic riders therefore understand that it is vital to stay near the front of the peloton on an important section, with or without help from teammates. This strategy only makes the gravel race harder, as the urge to be near the front will only further increase the pace of the peloton.\n\nHow to avoid snakebite flats\nOnce you’ve started the gravel section from somewhere near the front, you can’t sit too close on the wheel of the rider in front of you. If he makes a mistake, then you have a problem as well. Keeping better sight of the upcoming stretches of road is another good reason to stay near the front of the peloton. Also, a gravel section is usually not very smooth and you want to avoid hitting the holes in the road. Because if you ride flat out through these holes, you run the risk of snakebite flats in both tires.\n\nA completely different remedy to avoid snakebite flats is of course to fit tubeless tires. If you cannot avoid a hole, it is important to lift your butt and distribute your weight, so that your body absorbs the shock instead of the rim and tires on your bicycle’s wheels. It is also important to hit hard segments of gravel road at high speed and keep the momentum for as long as possible. The handling of the handlebar is something of an art as well. You cannot hold it too tightly or your hands will become all blistered really quickly, but because of the bad roads you still need to grip the bars with some conviction. Your weight should not be too much on the front wheel, so that you can let the front wheel find its way. And absorb potholes hits with your arms.\n\nSo on gravel a cyclist is more dependent on himself and can benefit less from teammates or the rider in front. Therefore everyone wants to start from the front to choose their own track and keep the speed as high as possible to take that kinetic energy with them. This is an ideal cocktail for a cycling war on every gravel section and that’s exactly what makes Strade Bianche so exciting and an instant classic from the first edition. To the average Joe, riding gravel is mainly about the great outdoor experience in beautiful surroundings, often without cars and other traffic to spoil the fun.\n\n\nThe specifics of a gravel bike\nFinally, a word about the gravel bike. Bicycle companies will tell you that everyone needs a gravel bike, of course! But most of the pro’s don’t ride on gravel bikes that often. And if they do, it’s likely more a publicity blitz for their bicycle brand sponsor rather than their own choice. Compared to a normal road bike, a gravel bike has a somewhat lazier geometry. This means that the head tube is less steep and therefore the bike handles a little less aggressively. Also the rear fork is often a bit longer for the same effect and more comfort. The gravel bike is usually also designed to provide a little more comfort on rougher surfaces. That often makes them too heavy and not stiff enough to serve as a weapon of choice for the pro’s.\n\nTires on a Gravel Bike\n\nA gravel bike obviously has a lot more tire clearance, to allow for the use of much wider tires than on a road bike. The wider the tire, the lower the pressure can be, which improves comfort a lot. Tubeless tires are also a very good idea here, as the absence of an inner tube eliminates the risk of snakebite flats. Broader tires are also heavier and with that gravel thread pattern, their rolling resistance when used on tarmac is a lot higher. Broader tires also make disc brakes a must. So pro’s usually ride with tires that are not wider than 26 mm-28 mm to be able to still go fast on the tarmac stretches that most races still have.\nIf you don’t ride the most extreme gravel roads, you can use your regular road bike fitted with 28 mm or 30 mm tubeless tires (if they fit in that road bike’s frame), with slightly lower tire pressure than you would apply on the road. Maybe don’t use your Zipp 808 rims, but opt for a lower and less stiff rim with a few spokes more than in weight weenie road rims. Don’t start sprinting at the first gravel section either, but ease into it."

    "content": "Weight is one of the decisive factors in cycling performance. Especially in professional cycling, the urge to lose weight runs really deep. In the Grand Tours (Tour de France, Giro d’Italia, Vuelta d’Espana) the flyweights are calling the shots in the GC. The era when a big and strong Danish or Spanish cyclist won the Tour de France seems to be long behind us. Yet low weight also has its downsides. This article discusses the pros and cons of a cyclist with a low weight.\nOn the flats, weight not a big factor\nThe body of a professional cyclist consists of approximately 10% fat, 15 % bone and 50 % muscle mass. This means that a cyclist weighing 70 kilos will have 7 kilos. On the flats, weight is not a big factor as air resistance is the biggest factor to overcome. A kilo more or less has a small effect on the frontal surface. For comparison, a cyclist riding alone at a speed of 42 km/h in a windless environment will have to overcome about 87% air resistance, 10% rolling resistance and about 3% loss in the transmission of the rotating parts. For this he will have to deliver a total of 350 Watt. The weight does have an influence on the rolling resistance, but a difference of for instance two kilos only saves about 0.5 W. Even in a sport that is fanatically looking for margin gains, this is negligible. On top of that, body mass is an important factor in acceleration ability, like in a demarrage and during sprints, but that is beyond the scope of this article.\nIn the mountains weight has impact\nIf we go into the mountains, the impact of 2 kilos is a lot bigger. At a gradient of 9%, our 70 kilo cyclist will ride at 16 km/h if he pushes the same 350 W. But given that low speed, the aerodynamic resistance is only 5% of the overall resistance while the resistance provided by the gradient (gravity!) is no less than 88% of the total resistance to overcome. With two kilos less body weight, 10 W less power is needed to ride at the same speed. Or, the other way around, with the same power, a cyclist that weighs 2 kilos less goes 0.5 km/h faster.\nOn the basis of this theoretical explanation, it therefore seems rather obvious that trainers, teams and riders strive for as low a weight as possible. For the GC contenders in Grand Tours this means that they aim for a fat percentage of between 5% and 8%. However, this is not the percentage of fat that they can sustain all year round, but certainly aim for it when the start of one of the Grand Tours looms.\nlow fat percentages\nIn order to achieve such low fat percentages, a strict diet tailored to the training load is indispensable. You will eventually have to train with a negative energy balance in order to lose weight. This simply means that the intake of kilocalories must be less than the consumption. On an average training day, a professional cyclist burns about 3000 kilocalories. In addition, fuel is also needed for the normal metabolism of the body, which means that in total about 4200 kilocalories should be consumed to prevent shortages. To create a deficiency in which the body can still optimally recover from the training efforts is a very complicated and finely balanced puzzle. Recent research has shown that the base metabolism of frequent athletes is lower in rest than in less active people. This is probably caused by the fact that a person prefers to be less active after heavy exertion. Cyclists are therefore expected to be slacking on the sofa as much as possible if they are not training.\nWhat about ketones\nIf we go back to two kilos of weight loss, it is essential to create deficits so that stored fat tissue is converted into energy. The process in which your body enters a state in which the body fat is converted into energy is called ketosis. In this process, stored fat tissue is converted into ketones (indeed, those infamous ketones) and used as energy for the cells. Ketones are therefore nothing more than a natural extra source of energy. The conversion of fat tissue into ketones does not happen when there are enough carbohydrates nearby to convert into energy. That’s why you quite literally have to starve yourself to encourage the body to use stored fat as energy. Training with a low carbohydrate supply (sober training) for example, is a method to achieve this.\nHowever, this is not without its dangers. The greatest danger lies in the fact that your energy systems are never really completely separated, but are always mixed up. For example, the body always burns a little protein, but as long as the intensity is low enough or there are enough carbohydrates present, you will only burn a little protein. These proteins are essential for muscle building. When the carbohydrates are almost depleted and your body starts to burn stored fat tissue, you will also use more proteins as energy. This not only reduces weight, but will also cause loss of strength because muscle tissue is not regenerated properly. You have then basically started eating yourself! The tell tale sign is a very unpleasant ammonia taste in your mouth. The puzzle in training physiology nowadays is to lose weight by training with a negative energy balance, but without a loss of power.\nThe problem of a deficient immune system\nExtremely low fat percentages also have their drawbacks. Firstly, it is mentally extremely hard to stick to a very (very!) strict training and nutrition regime over a longer period of time. This also explains the weight fluctuations of the Grand Tour favorites. In addition, hormone functions can deteriorate with reduced production of estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Because of these reduced hormonal functions, osteoporosis (bone density reduction) is also lurking. This causes faster bone fractures in the event of accidents. The functioning of the immune system also suffers, as a result of which a person can more easily fall ill. Top form and getting sick are therefore very close to each other in top sports. Of course, this can completely negate the entire performance improvement. Trying to lose weight and improve performance while staying healthy is quite tricky to do and without the right guidance not nearly as easy as it might seem."

    "content": "Before you start exercising vigorously there are some basics you should get familiar with first. This article will get you up to speed with some of the most essential must-knows.\nHow training works for cycling\nWe start with the principle of training in cycling. Training itself makes you tired, but then you recover and improve. Maybe you’ve heard of the supercompensation effect. Many people know the principle, but even at the very highest level it is still not always properly understood and executed. The principle is actually quite simple: you don’t get better during training, but you get better by recovering after training. A workout tires your body, during the subsequent recovery your body tries to prepare itself better for the next time you put training stress on it. That also means that if your body is still recovering from the last session, you shouldn’t start another training yet.\nIf you apply this rule properly you should start exercising at the very moment your body is not only recovered but even slightly stronger than before your last workout. And if you wait too long, the training effect will have faded already. The moment your body is at this peak depends on how fast your body recovers and how hard the last workout was. The better you get, the faster you recover, so the more training your body can handle and by that, the better you get. Et voila, just like that you are in a virtuous circle on your way to the pro ranks!\nConsistency\nSecondly the most scientifically proven concept of training is consistency. So before you start bothering yourself with intensity distributions, tapering or periodization, first make sure that you just go out and train. After a long training period one week of rest can allow the body to recover and improve. But training one week and taking a week of rest afterwards will bring you very little fitness gains. So first and foremost try to create training possibilities during the week and stick to them, instead of training one week for ten hours and the next week for only two. I have already mentioned intensity distribution, something you can write a good and long book about, which at least 50 authors have already done. So we won’t get too deep into the specifics in the context of this short article.\nTrain specifically\nHowever, one very important rule is that you have to train specifically. To exaggerate: that means that if you want to train to become a better cyclist it makes no sense to start ski jumping. To put it differently, if you train for a long cyclosportive like La Marmotte, you need to analyze what specific qualities are required for a challenge like that and focus the training on those requirements. For the Marmotte you will need a lot of endurance, so you need to train long distances. And before anyone that tells you that a certain exercise or workout is really good, please realize there is no such thing as a good workout. There is only a good combination of workouts (or a bad one) depending on what level you are at, where your strengths and weaknesses lie and what you are training for. Once you know this, you can train on it specifically, i.e. in the right intensity zones.\nTrainingzones, heart rate and power\nTraining zones can help to determine the right training intensity. You can work with heart rate or power zones, but if you have the choice, please use power based zones. Both are based on the fact that you have a certain heart rate or power level that you can keep up for an hour. This is called your threshold heart rate or functional threshold power (FTP). You can do an exercise test in a lab or do a 20 minute, DIY field test and take 95% of the power/heart rate to make a good estimate. This heart rate or power is set as the 100% when determining the training zones. There are different ways to classify the zones.\nDifference between heart rate and power zones\nHeart rate zones and power zones don’t match one on one. And please do not try to match them both anyway. Heart rate is highly influenced by the former workouts you have done, the amount of sleep, stress, fatigue, caffeine, dehydration and much more. Also power isn’t always working like clockwork, because sometimes you have a good day and sometimes you just don’t. But to put it short, if heart rate was a valid and reliable indicator to measure the intensity of a training session, then the power meter would have never been invented!\nIf one day your heart rate is lower for a certain power output then the week before, don’t start celebrating just yet but take into consideration the other factors that could play a role. But if you spot a trend over multiple workouts you are probably progressing. Hurray! Also, power zones differentiate above 100%. The reason for that is that the heart rate response is quite slow. It takes some time to rev up the heart rate. So while you were sprinting your lungs out over 40 seconds, your heart rate was probably still half way in the D3-zone. So looking at a heart rate monitor to check your performance at short sprints is quite useless.\nAm I on the right track?\nOne of the most beautiful things about cycling is that everyone from young to old can still improve. In other sports that involve more power and explosiveness, that’s much more difficult. In addition to the physical part of cycling, you can also improve in many other areas. For example, you can improve the sleeping, nutrition, recovery, equipment, tactics or the mental part of cycling.\nSome of this is easy to measure. For example, you can use an app to calculate your calorie intake and compare it with the calories you burned as indicated by your power meter. It is also possible to use your mobile phone or smartwatch to keep track of your amount of sleep. By adding more regularity to your sleep you can easily gain an hour’s sleep or even improve the quality of your sleep.\nKeeping track of physical progress is a little more complicated. Of course there are plenty of programs that make nice graphs, but what exactly do you have to look at? And how do you check if you’re really making progress?\nHow to measure progress\nFirst of all, we must ensure that progress can be measured objectively. But it is also very important to listen to your body to tell you if you are on the right track. Those subjective feelings are especially important when you have been ill or feel exhausted. But for now, we are looking at objective ways to show your progress. You can do this by following a standardized protocol. To chart your fitness accurately, you need to make it measurable, objective and reproducible. This way you can take the same measurement before and after a period of training and see if there is an improvement.\nYou can do this by measuring your speed over the same lap and see if your average speed has improved. But of course weather conditions have a big influence on this speed, especially the wind and the air pressure. For example, many recreational cyclists who are able to ride a fixed course at an average speed of 30 km/h in summer, might only average 28 km/h on the same course in winter. But their fitness could be at the same level, however, the higher air density in winter causes the drop in average speed. So speed is not the best way to measure your progress. But what do you have to measure then? Actually there is only one clear answer: power.\nProgress of your endurance\nTo really measure the progress of your endurance, you need to see how long you can hold a certain amount of power. A common way is to look at the maximum average power you can hold for 20 minutes. To measure this you also need to make sure your test is standardized. So do the test under the same conditions, use the same power meter, do the same warm-up and make sure you have taken as much rest as before the other tests. With this in mind, it is advisable to do this indoors on a home/smart trainer rather than outdoors where the weather and the traffic are unpredictable factors.\nBut is the value of your 20 minutes of power the tell-all and the best way to determine your progress? That depends on your personal goals. If you want to do a 15-40 minute climb as fast as possible, this value is very interesting. But if you’re training for a 200 km ride with short climbs in it, this FTP value is a lot less interesting. To get a wider picture of your fitness you can also do standardized 1- and 5-minute tests. From these you can then determine your ‘power profile’.\nWhat is a power profile?\nA power profile is a graph or table that shows your best power for a specific time interval, often between 10 seconds and 3 hours. It shows the maximum power output over the last 3 months or the best ever. Improvement of a power at a certain time interval shows your improvement quite simply. Determining a power profile is currently the most widely used tool in cycling to map progress. But this method does not contain everything you want to know. Often it’s not about how fast you ride up one mountain, but how fast you ride up the fifth or maybe twentieth mountain over the course on a long ride. Deep in the finals of a race like the Tour of Flanders, the men and the boys are separated. After well over 200 km of racing and steep, sometimes cobbled climbs, someone’s power profile is less important, it’s all about the power you can still produce at that moment. Which rider’s power has fallen the least during the race?\nSummarize\nFirst of all, make sure you have a goal to work towards so that you know where you want to improve. Next, it is important to test yourself regularly. Please note that not every training should be a test! Test yourself with a standardized test, every 4 to 6 weeks is more than enough to know if you are on the right track. Last but certainly not least, look not only at your maximum power but also at the power you can still deliver in the last hour of a heavy training, a long cyclosportive ride or a race.\nWith this basis you have sufficient knowledge to set your goal and what is needed to achieve it. Make a plan and stick to it! If you don’t feel comfortable doing that on your own, a trainer can help you make a plan and a schedule so you have an incentive to keep going."

    "content": "Nowadays, every professional bike rider seems to go on an altitude training camp. If we believe the experts, the Tour de France cannot even be won anymore without going on one. What is the effects of altitude training and how big is the performance enhancement? And maybe even more important: what does it bring you as an amateur cyclist?\n\nThe principle of altitude training\n\nLet’s start with the physiological effects of altitude training. The human body needs oxygen to function. Oxygen gets in your lungs and into your deepest lung vesicles, where it is absorbed into the blood to be transported to wherever it is needed in the body. Contrary to what often is thought there is not less oxygen at altitude. The percentage of oxygen in the air is 21% at any elevation. However, the air pressure does decrease at altitude, leading to lower  oxygen tension in the lungs. The pressure on your deepest lung vesicles to deliver oxygen to the blood is therefore reduced and your body absorbs less oxygen. Of course, this limits performance, but it can also inhibit your normal daily functioning.\n\nLuckily, the body has developed a cure. The human body is able to adapt (acclimatize) to altitude. The immediate adaptations are the increase in breathing and a higher heart rate. For cyclists, this is of little use if you are already at a maximum level of exertion. The longer term adjustments are more interesting, i.e. adjusting the composition of the blood and making muscle cells more efficient. When you are at altitude, the body gives a signal to produce more red blood cells that are responsible for the oxygen transport. It takes a while for this production to ramp up but these effects also remain present for a while, even when you have already descended back down to sea level. The hormone erythropoietin is responsible for this signal and indeed this hormone is better known as EPO.\nAltitude training is natural doping\nSo, in a way, altitude training is natural doping. In addition, a long stay at altitude ensures adaptation at the level of the muscle cell. The density and number of mitochondria (the energy factories in the muscle cell), where energy is converted with the help of oxygen, increases, as does the capillarity of the muscle cells, i.e. they contain more blood vessels and thereby an improved blood circulation.\n\nDecrease of training stimilus\n\nSo far a stay at altitude for a grand tour seems all very logical. But there is a catch. The problem at altitude is that even after a long stay and thus maximum acclimatization, the capacity of the body to exercise is reduced. So at altitude you cannot simply train as hard, so the training stimulus is lower. The higher you get, the lower the training stimulus becomes. Therefore, if you stay too high for too long, the body’s adjustments are counteracted by the loss of good training stimuli and your overall performance will deteriorate. As a solution to this problem, the so-called Live High-Train Low principle has been devised. Here the athlete is at altitude for most of the day but he or she trains lower or even at sea level to be able to train at maximum intensity. In science, this form of training has proven to be the most effective, but it requires an enormous logistical operation. This is where the oxygen tent has proven useful. In such a tent, the air pressure is not lowered, but the oxygen content corresponds with a stay at a certain altitude. There are even cyclists that bring their entire bedroom up to a simulated height in this way. The problem is that you have to spend most of the day in your bedroom to achieve the effects. Think at least 14 hours a day and that’s not much fun in your oxygen tent or even your bedroom.\nThe right altitude\n\nIn the end, it’s all about timing and choosing the right altitude. There has been a period when it was thought that some athletes were not suited to altitude training. 1 out of 4 athletes would react badly to altitude. By now it has been established that every person’s body eventually adapts to the altitude, but at a different pace. Especially in the first few days it is very important to let the body get used to the altitude very gradually and not to train too hard right away. Some people are already quite well acclimatized after 4 days, while others need to take it really easy for at least a week. This is no exact science, so especially cyclists who are going on altitude training for the first time, it is really a matter of trial and error.\n\nThe altitude where you can expect real performance benefits is at least 1800 meters. But training at an altitude higher than 3000 meters is never really done because the body has to recover far too long before the next training can be done and the training stimuli at that altitude are too low. In general, training and staying at the same altitude between 2000 and 2500 meters is ideal. If the training can be done at a lower altitude, the stay can be slightly higher at between 2500 and 3000 meters.\nAcclimatization effects of altitude training\n\nBecause the acclimatization effects in the blood only start after about 5 days, it is important to stay at altitude long enough. In the literature, a minimum stay of 14 days is seen as the minimum, while in practice most altitude training camps last for 21 days or more.\nThe positive effect of an altitude training camp at this altitude of ~3 weeks lasts for between 1-1.5 months. It is also important to note that many cyclists experience a performance peak in the first week after returning to sea level, but often deteriorate in the second week before experiencing a performance peak again. That is why most cyclists return from their altitude training stage about 2 to 3 weeks before a grand tour.\n\nThe individual differences with altitude training\n\nFinally, in addition to these figures and facts, it is ultimately the athlete who has to do it. For example, a lot of altitude training camps end in disappointment, because the training environment is too monotonous. Or because the logistics of sleeping at altitude and training at low altitude are too demanding. In addition, some places to train at altitude may be ideal for training, but they are far too isolated from the outside world, or perhaps the hotel and the food are very disappointing. Some of these might sound trivial, but one person can handle this much better than the next, but these things can and do determine the success of an altitude training camp. That is why a successful altitude training camp requires careful planning and experience to get the most out of it.\n\nBecause of these complicating factors, it is also not so easy to predict the degree of performance improvement from altitude training. There are many studies that show, for example, no effect or even a negative effect of altitude training. The fact that half of the pro cycling peloton nevertheless goes on altitude training can probably be explained by their high degree of professionalism and the individualized approach by trainers and coaches of these professional cyclists. It therefore seems wiser for the ‘simple’ amateur to first consider if there are simpler things, such as better training and nutrition, that can be improved before setting off to a place at more than 2000 meters above sea level."

    "content": "Since in winter there are no road races to ride, the virtual bicycle racing platform of Zwift (and other platforms) is a very popular alternative. In this article we try to give you the best tips and tricks so you can get the best results. We cover power output, temperature regulation, warming-up and the difference between the power you can push indoors and outdoors. Of course we assume that you don’t cheat by setting your weight lower than it actually is!\nThe courses on Zwift are characterized by their extreme character, especially the start is usually incredibly hard. The first few minutes you will ride (far) above your FTP, so it is important to be prepared for this when you decide to ride a virtual race. Think of it as a cyclocross race start: full throttle from the gun! Right from the start, the racing is often just below the threshold point, spiced up with some climbs and other hard stretches above the FTP. Luckily most races usually only last around 40-60 minutes. The finals are hard and the podium is often decided in a sprint. However, this sprint is longer than on the road as the last kilometers are really at full speed.\nHowever, keep in mind that you never keep your legs still and always will have pressure on the legs, so all in all it can be really hard! See for example the heartbeat and power graph of a course below. You can clearly see that you never get to pedal quietly and spend quite some time near the threshold HR (dotted line).\n\nNutrition during Zwift Races\nSo races on Zwift are very hard and your power output will often be close to your FTP, so you will burn muscle glycogen (sugars stored in your muscles) throughout the race. This is not bad, as long as this supply of glycogen is full when you start, otherwise you run the risk of getting hungry right away. So beforehand it’s important to have eaten a good meal rich in carbohydrates. Depending on the time you start racing, try to eat your last meal at least 2 hours before the start. During the warm-up you can eat a small snack (e.g. a banana or a sports bar) so that the sugars are immediately available from the start of the race.\nBecause Zwift races courses are generally not very long, you might be tempted not to have extra food available during the race. However, with a good warm-up and cooling-down you’ll easily spend an hour and a half in the saddle. Below you’ll find some general guidelines, so be aware of how long you expect to be busy.\nAfter riding a Zwift course it is especially important to replenish your muscle glycogen immediately. This can be done by consuming some rapidly easily sugars within half an hour after the race. This can be a coke or some wine gums, but also some fruit (which has a high glucose-fructose content, which is good for recovery). Depending on the next training sessions you can also choose to take some proteins directly, for example if you have a strength training planned at the end of the day.\nText continues below the images\n\n\nImages via Asker Jeukendrup, www.mysportscience.com\nHeat management: keeping the body cool.\nSince we ride on indoor trainers, there is no wind, which is actually quite nice because you never have to find a headwind. However, that wind takes care of most of the cooling of our body. During exertion, the measured power is only 20-25% of the total power that the body produces, so muscle contractions are not that efficient. The remaining power is released in the form of heat, so the body produces quite a large amount of it during exercise. You have to get rid of this heat in order not to overheat and see your power fall away. Already a small increase in your skin and core temperature will immediately and negatively affect your performance! The cooler you can make the space in which your Zwift contraption stands, the less this decay!\nSo really make sure you have enough ventilators blowing or windows open! If you see Zwifting purely as training (and not as a goal in itself), you can also choose to take a leaf from the book of heat acclimatization. By performing regularly in the heat over a period of about 2 weeks you will acclimatize to this and you will be able to perform well in the heat later. However, always make sure that you do not make this ‘heat stimulus’ too big, the heat management of your body is easily kicked out of balance, with various negative consequences.\nAs a last pro tip related to heat, it is smart to pre-cool the body well in advance, this can be done for example by eating an ice cream 5 minutes before the start! If you have cooling vests, be sure to use them! The cooler you stay during the race, the better your power levels can be maintained and the better your performance will be.\nWarming-up and cooling down, getting ready to race.\nBecause the start of a Zwift race determines everything, a good warm-up is crucial. Take your time for this! We recommend the following warm-up protocol:\n\n10 min quiet pace, 5 min “Steigerungen”, where you slowly step up the pace until you ride at your FTP in the last minute.\n5 min recovery, loosen the legs\ntwo, 15-second sprints with 2 minutes rest in between\n8 minutes quiet pace\n\nThen you can get off your bike for a few minutes and make sure that everything is alright and you are ready for the fast paced start! After your race it is important to lower your heart rate after that final sprint. Ride on low power and intensity for at least 10 minutes (but preferably a bit longer) after the finish. This will ascertain that the lactate that you produced during the race can be broken down again and that you don’t have too heavy legs in the next few days.\nindoor versus outdoor, the short story.\nMany riders complain about the fact that they can only pedal with much less power inside compared to outside. Not much scientific research has been done on this, but the conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that cycling outside has a much higher variability in power and less static load than cycling inside. We will come back to this extensively in a different blog post.\nCooling by means of the wind lowers the temperature of the body which ensures better performance outside than in a situation indoors that is not properly cooled. If cooling is done properly, there is no significant difference between performance indoors or outdoors! So don’t forget that ice cream, cooling vest and fan the next time you start a Zwift session!\nZwift tactics.\nFirst of all, be ready for a hard start, as described above, so a good warm-up is vital. Zwift has done its utmost to mimic the so-called draft effect, which means that you can benefit from driving closely behind somebody else. So make really good use of this, you can tell by your posture on the bike if you’re well in the draft; if you’re sitting upright then you’re well hidden, if you’re riding the virtual you low in the handlebars then you’re riding in the wind!\nAs your Zwift level increases, better bikes and wheels become available. This material can provide a better aerodynamic or lighter bike, so choose the smartest material for each race. In about an hour, the fastest bike can save more than a minute compared to the slowest! That brings us right to the point of trail exploration. There are an awful lot of routes on which you can ride and each route has its own peculiarities. A short course exploration on the internet is often really worthwhile, so that you can see where it is smart to sit at the front. Keep in mind that just after a climb the peloton (just like in real life) goes on a ribbon and gaps can appear, so always pay attention!\nNext to that there are of course power-ups in Zwift, actually 3 important ones:\n\nSpring: this will lighten your resistance by 9.5kg for 15 seconds, so use it on the steepest stretches of a climb!\nTruck: makes your draft effect 3x bigger for 30 seconds, so you can take the pressure of the pedals just a little bit, without dropping out of the peloton.\nAero helmet: makes you 25% more aerodynamic for 15 seconds, so you can reach high speeds with high power. Super handy in the final sprint!\n\nBecause Zwift racing is really hard, we advise you to not do too many races every week, especially because every race brings a certain mental strain. So think carefully about how a race fits in your training week, always make sure it’s balanced by steady endurance training."

    "content": "What can I do with the ‘Training stress score’?\nWhat does it mean and how can it help you to improve? The idea of training is to give the body a stimulus. A workout causes fatigue in the body after which the body realizes that the next time it needs to be better prepared for such a stimulus. This principle is also explained in ‘The basics of training’. During the recovery from a workout your body adapts and the fitness level improves. Depending on the intensity of the training you will need to rest for a certain period of time before you can start the next training session. To bring this training principle into practice effectively, it is important to evaluate how hard a training session was. Of course, training sessions come in all shapes and sizes. There are short, intensive training sessions and longer, extensive training sessions, but there are also a lot in between. With so many different types of training it seems almost impossible to compare them with each other. Fortunately, the Training Stress Score (TSS) has been devised to do that for you.\nIntensity Factor x duration\nThe idea of this is quite simple. The formula is to multiply the Intensity Factor (IF) by the duration of the ride in hours and multiply it by 100.\nOne hour of cycling at your FTP-level (Functional Threshold Power) based on normalized power equals to a TSS of 100. So two hours at 50% of your FTP would also result in a TSS of 100 and 30 minutes at double your FTP (which is humanly impossible) would also result in a score of 100 points.\nWith this number you can compare a short intensive training with a long extensive endurance training and their impacts on your body. All training stress scores of the last few weeks or months give you a good indication of how much you are actually doing. In the era before the power meters and TSS, the number of hours of the last few weeks or months was simply added up without taking the intensity into account. This often resulted in more and more training hours at a lower intensity, but less training hours at a higher intensity.\nTraining load\nIncreasing the training load in the right way is one of the most difficult concepts of training. First of all, you have to time a training session right. When the body has not recovered enough from the previous workout, the next workout only leads to more fatigue in the body. In fact, if a workout was so heavy that a long recovery period was needed, then the body will improve by very little. The training stress score is a good way to monitor the training load and helps to prevent you from starting to do too much. However, there is still one important point to be noted. When two training sessions lead to the same training stress score it does not mean that the effect of both training sessions is the same. A short strength training can have the same TSS as a long slow ride to train fat burning. The training stress score is the same but the effect of the training and the way the body adapts is totally different. For this reason it is still important to monitor both the intensity factor and the training stress score when looking at the training load.\nHow to get better?\nGetting better is all about timing. There are actually no good or bad workouts, there is only a bad combination or the wrong workout at the wrong moment. The path towards progress is therefore a training plan with the right training stimulus taking into account to your level, goal and available time. To help you with that we developed an algorithm in the EnduroCo Cycling application. It provides you with a highly flexible training plan to makes sure you get the most out of your rides. You can download EnduroCo in the App Store and Play store. Or check this page for more info."

    "content": "You might have heard of it, but there is also a good chance that you are unfamiliar with the specifics of this concept. “Heart rate decoupling”, sometimes also called Aerobic Decoupling (AD) has been around for a while. Especially in running, heart rate decoupling has been used for some time as an effective tool for training sessions analysis. But you can also use it in cycling. We will explain what it is and how to use it in this article.\nHeart rate decoupling is actually not a very complicated calculation. You divide your training into two parts and calculate the ratio between power and heart rate over both halves. Then you divide these two numbers to get the difference between these two ratios.\nRelationship between power and heart rate.\nBut what does this number say? It simply shows the heart rate at which the body has to work to deliver the same power. In other words, it shows the decrease in power at the same heart rate. But why is this data point interesting? Assuming that heart rate reflects the amount of work the body does, it shows that when the body gets tired, it has to work harder to deliver the same watts. The idea of heart rate decoupling is that there is a relationship between heart rate and power. With the aforementioned equation you can see whether heart rate and power run parallel to each other or whether the heart rate differs from the power.\nHeart rate decoupling shows the effect of fatigue.\nThis value shows the heart rate at which your body is tired. Now that you know this, you can compare different workouts to see if you are getting better. But before you compare all workouts, you have to look out for some pitfalls. For starters, the relationship between heart rate and power is quite reliable up to your aerobic threshold. Above this point (where fat burning is at its maximum), the relationship becomes less reliable. Your aerobic threshold is normally between 80 and 95% of anaerobic threshold or FTP. Heart rate decoupling should not be used for training sessions with many intervals above the aerobic threshold and that makes heart rate decoupling especially suitable for analyzing longer endurance rides.\nThe delay in heart rate.\nThere is also a delay in the heart rate when the intensity changes where power shows the change immediately. So if the intensity is very variable you can see this clearly in power graphs but much less so in the heart rate chart. For this reason, for heart rate decoupling you will need to use workouts that are uniform, without too many intervals and changes in intensity. Also, the training should have a certain length to be able to see the slowing of the heart beat frequency. In order to get a reliable picture, the training should last at least one hour.\nHeart rate numbers can be misleading.\nAnother pitfall are the many conditions that can affect the heart rate that have nothing to do with fatigue. Coffee or other products containing caffeine can lead to a higher heart rate at the same power levels. So if you stop halfway through your workout for a nice espresso, this can distort the heart rate readings. A few nights of poor sleep can also affect the heart rate. During your workout this will increase and your heart rate will drop again. But because the heart rate was high in the beginning, this can lead to a negative value for heart rate decoupling. Dehydration has an even greater effect on the heart rate. When your body has too little fluid, the heartbeat and power will no longer run in parallel. But this also works the other way around. If you suspect dehydration you can use the value from heart rate decoupling to determine the degree of dehydration.\nWhat is a good heart rate decoupling?\nSo if you keep these in mind, what numbers are we looking at? Normally a value below 5% for heart rate decoupling during an endurance ride is considered good. Of course, the length of the workout has a big influence on that value. The duration of the ride should match your personal goals. If you train for a particular race or ride that lasts longer than four hours, the first step is to achieve a heart rate decoupling of less than 5% over an endurance ride of three hours. Once that has been achieved, your endurance capability is at a level that you can add some more intensive workouts to your schedule. But if you don’t reach that 5% yet, it’s advisable to train a bit more on your endurance first. Heart rate decoupling is very useful at the beginning of your training plan. It helps you to determine whether you are ready for the second phase of training which contains more intensive training, or whether it is better to work a bit longer on your basic condition in the first phase of your training plan. Always keep in mind that you use low-intensity workouts for your analysis that are at least one hour long. And when you want to compare two workouts to determine your progress, compare two workouts with more or less the same intensity and under the same conditions."

    "content": "What is the ideal cadence?\nOne of the most written about subjects in cycling is the cadence. One of the reasons is that nowadays there is a very wide range to choose from. Looking back at the 1980’s, the smallest chainring had 42 teeth and the biggest sprocket was a 19T. Today you can buy group sets with 34T for both the chainring as well as the cassette which can give you a gearing ratio that is twice as light. With these options available, even the steepest climbs have become rideable for almost everyone. Albeit at a rather low speed, if you need 34×34 to get to the top!\nBut in addition to the large range of chainrings and sprockets, we also see many professional cyclists riding up a mountain with quite a high cadence. This helps to heat up the discussions about cadence because most recreational cyclists find it hard to cycle with a high cadence (over 90 rpm or so). So what exactly is going on here? Before we dive into this, there are a few differences that are often overlooked. For example, there is a difference in ideal cadence, in which many factors play a role, and the most efficient cadence (the optimum between the energy consumption and delivered power).\nThe least oxygen consumption.\nContrary to what you might think, the most efficient cadence in terms of energy demand and power delivery is a low one. Research shows that for both experienced and inexperienced cyclists, oxygen consumption is significantly lower at a cadence of 60 rpm than at a higher cadence. So the answer to the question which is the most efficient cadence looks easy to answer. But this cuts a few corners. The problem with such a low cadence, for example, is that the muscle tension is very high. That means that a low cadence for one short climb might be a good choice. But what if you have several climbs ahead of you, or you want to perform well over a number of days back-to-back? And recommending an ideal cadence from the point of view of oxygen efficiency does not answer the question of why so many pros still ride at a high cadence. They’ll know what they’re doing, won’t they? They know for sure. Factors such as experience, power, muscle fiber type, slope and speed all play a role. Firstly, the muscle fiber type is important. A muscle works at its most efficient when it contracts at 1/3 of the maximum speed at which it can contract. The maximum speed at which a muscle can contract depends on the type of muscle fiber. The body contains fast and slow muscle fibers and the maximum contraction speed is different for both. An athlete with more anaerobic fast muscle fibers will therefore have a higher, ideal cadence than an athlete with a high aerobic capacity due to a relatively large presence of slow muscle fibers in the latter’s body.\nThe role of speed.\nThe slope of the road is also a factor that plays a big role. When you ride up a mountain there is less kinetic energy and your position on your bike is also different. This means that the peak force on the pedals is more likely to be in the downward pedal movement than when cycling on flat terrain. And because this pattern of force on your pedal changes, different muscle groups provide most of the force. This means that with higher speed and more kinetic energy on the flat, the ideal cadence will be between 90 to 100 rpm, depending on your speed. Uphill the ideal cadence will be between 70 and 80 rpm or even lower depending on the steepness of the climb.\nThe more power the higher the cadence.\nThirdly, power is an important factor. When you produce relatively little power, it is inefficient to have a high cadence because a lot of energy is lost with moving your legs while relatively little real power reaches the pedals. It seems that you also have to maintain a lower cadence at lower power. This also matches with the fitness level of the rider. A pro delivers much higher power levels, so the percentage of energy that is lost by the moving of the legs is small compared to an amateur cyclist. Experienced riders also have a better pedal movement. This means that at higher cadence the cooperation and coordination between the various muscle groups is better and there are no dead points in the pedal stroke. Less experienced riders have a less efficient power pattern when the cadence increases. Another factor is that experienced riders have more veins in their legs that can supply the muscles with more oxygen. This effect of training is called capillarity. Recent research has shown that there is less blood supply at high cadence levels compared to a low cadence at the same intensity. The theory is that more veins can reduce this difference or even completely counteract it.\nThe ideal cadence is very personal.\nIn short, there is no boilerplate answer to the question of what cadence is ideal for you. There are too many variables and possible outcomes. But fortunately the body is able to indicate the most comfortable and therefore your ideal cadence. All you have to do is to not overthink it and listen to your body. Don’t just imitate the pros that you see on the TV if you are not pro yourself. But keep training at both high and low cadences. Training is the way to put stress on your body, to which the body responds by improving. So training with different cadences will learn your body to work with both and thereby help you to get better overall."

    "content": "During a multi-day cycle event or a stage race it is important to maintain a positive energy balance (i.e. consume at least as many calories as your body has burned) in order to keep your body’s energy levels topped up. So it would be really useful to know how many calories you did burn. In this article we will explain how to convert Watts into kilocalories and what the limitations of this method are. Although there are some calculations and formulas involved, it’s not rocket science.\nLook at your power.\nLet’s look at a regular endurance training of two hours, done with an average power of 200 W. One Watt equals one joule per second (1 J/s). So every second during this ride, 200 joules of energy is produced. However, that is only a relatively small part of the total energy that your body has produced. When you cycle, a lot of your energy production is lost in the muscles in the form of heat. The basic functioning of body processes like the maintenance of cells, the brain functioning and breathing, gobbles up another chunk of this total energy production. The ratio of the total energy production in relation to the energy that actually reaches the paddles is called the Gross Efficiency (GE). For male cyclists, the average GE is about 21% while for women it is slightly lower at about 19-20%.\nExample.\nBack to the rider above. The 200 J/s pedal power output is only 21% of the total energy produced. So the total energy production was in fact 952 J/s (200/0.21) during the ride. Over two hours this equals (120 minutes x 60 seconds = 7200 seconds; 952 Joules x 7200 seconds = 6,854,400 Joules = 6854 kilojoules (KJ). One kilocalorie equals 4.1868 KJ. So during this 2-hour ride, 6854 KJ has been produced, which equals 1637 kcal. Are you still with us?\nCycling efficiency.\nWe have to realize that the GE of 21% is only an average. There are people with a lower or higher GE, ranging from 16 to 25%. The more efficient you are, the less work your body will have to do to produce the same Watts. If you are not trained yet and start training, your GE will automatically improve. This is mainly because the power you can deliver increases. As the power you can deliver increases, the percentage of the basal, metabolic energy needs in relation to total energy consumption decreases. The result is a better GE. Furthermore the GE improves when your power delivery is improving. The power delivery eventually plateaus at around 60% of your VO2 max power. When you are already well trained it is difficult to improve your GE by much.\nEfficiency falls during training.\nYour GE can decline during training. Intensive intervals around or above your FTP can cause a lower GE for the rest of that workout. This means that after a number of VO2 max intervals, you will ride the rest of that workout with a lower GE. This, by the way, is also the reason why you should not ride the first few kilometers of a time trial at power readings above your FTP, as that will leave you with a lower GE for the rest of that TT. The lower GE will also lead to underestimating the total energy produced. This does not matter too much for long extensive endurance rides, but at intensive interval training sessions in a hilly area, this can lead to quite big differences.\nCrunching the numbers.\nYou’re probably wondering now: what is the impact of a lower GE? Let’s compare an extreme example. We take a (talented) rider with a GE of 24% and a rider with a GE of 17%. This is a big difference but certainly not uncommon. When you cycle two hours with a power of 200 W with a 24% GE you will burn 1433 kcal. When you cycle two hours with a power of 200 W with a GE of 17% you will burn 2023 kcal. That is a substantial difference of 590 kcal. A difference that is bigger than a Big Mac!\nHow do we solve this?\nUnfortunately, science has not yet development a tool or a method that can calculate your GE at every moment during a workout. An exact GE can only be measured in a laboratory with (in)direct calorimetry. Until a good alternative is found, a GE of 21% is used as an approximation. But it is recommended for experienced cyclists to keep the time above FTP in mind when approaching their GE. Because then we can make a fairly accurate estimates of how much granola, cottage cheese, fish or beer a rider should consume to replenish his energy supplies."

    "content": "That’s great! And it is probably the reason that you are reading this article, hoping to lose weight while or through exercising. But let me first dash your hopes: you probably won’t. The scientific ‘British Journal of Sports Medicine’ once put it rather succinctly: “You cannot outrun a bad diet”. Your weight, or rather your overweight is quite simply the result of the difference between your calorie intake and your calorie use. It would seem logical that when you increase your energy use by exercising, you will automatically lose weight. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. To explain why this is the case, we first need to focus on the different types of energy consumption.\nDo I need to burn fat to lose weight?\nYour body relies on three types of energy sources; carbohydrates, fat and protein. Burning the latter is not a good idea, because those proteins are essential for muscle recovery. The body knows this and only starts using protein after the other two sources have run out. You might have experienced this once after a very, very long and hard ride, the tell tale sign is the (horrible) smell of ammonia. The first option, carbs, is the most efficient one. But the problem with carbs is that the body’s storage ability is not that big. An untrained body has about 300 to 400 grams of carbs stored in the liver and muscles while a trained individual can double this capacity. The higher the intensity of a training session gets, the more your body relies on burning carbs. When you exercise at your FTP or threshold heart rate you will exhaust this storage in about an hour, while the maximum carbs intake is 60-90 grams per hour. By the way, at lower intensities, some carbs are also still being used as energy. For example to keep your brain and other vital organs functioning.\nHow to burn fat?\nThe body’s real energy bomb is fat. The availability of it is nearly infinite, even when your body fat percentage is quite low and everybody else thinks you are really skinny! The only problem with fat is that the body needs a lot of oxygen to turn that fat into fuel. Exercising at a high intensity, your body depends almost exclusively on carbs, but at a low intensity your body burns mostly fat. If you want to lose weight then exercising at this low intensity is the only way to do it. Burning carbs, you lose very little weight because your body will be craving to replenish that carb storage in the liver and muscles after the training. This is a natural process that cannot be altered or tricked. Take also into account that the better your stamina gets, the higher the training intensity will be at which your body can still rely on burning fat. So especially for those who start exercising with the idea of losing weight, the intensity should be really low to actually burn fat. Even so low that it doesn’t feel like exercising. And then still, the training sessions should also really be very long to have any effect.\nDon’t forget the calories!\nHere we have addressed the fact why you probably don’t lose much weight when you start exercising. But there is more. If you exercise you cannot just add those burned calories to the normal energy expenditure. Studies show that the basic metabolism of people who exercise is lower. It seems that when we have done a workout, we have a tendency to reward ourselves by being less active and even sin by having not that great food. By now you are probably thinking that the above does not apply for you. You are probably someone who will beat the statistics and start to exercise at exactly that low enough intensity and long enough duration, while also tackling the mental hurdles.\nKeep it fun.\nEven then losing weight through exercising just doesn’t make sense. It’s like eating soup with a teaspoon. It can work but it takes ages and you probably don’t even enjoy the soup. If you still want to have fun exercising, extremely low intensity and monotonously long sessions are not the way to do it. Having fun with what you do is actually one of the strongest and even scientifically proven incentives to stick to an exercise regime. On top of that, it would be a pity to exercise only at a low intensity because you will miss out on all the other benefits to your stamina of exercising at a higher intensity.\nSo if you want to lose weight you need to change what and how much you eat. If you’re struggling with your weight, more often than not there is something wrong with your diet and/or lifestyle. So start exercising because of all the associated benefits and the fun of it, but also as part of a lifestyle change. Don’t just try to eat the soup with a teaspoon although you will probably lose weight by doing so."

    "description": "Why use NP for your training?\n            Normalized power (NP) is one of the most used but also most confusing terms in cycling training jargon. You have probably heard some assumptions about this term, many of them...",
    "content": "What’s NP? And what isn’t?\nNormalized power is actually an algorithm that calculates the physiological load of an interval training. It was introduced by TrainingsPeaks and is used to express the difference in load on the body of a steady state power ride and a ride with a lot of variation in power. As an example we take someone that rides at a steady pace for tho hours with an average of 200W and someone else who rides at the same, 200W average, but produces 50W in the first hour and 350W in the second hour. Both rides have the same average power, but their NP is clearly different. The physiological strain and differences in intensity of both training sessions are not well expressed when you only look at the average power of these rides. In this case normalized power would come in handy. The calculation of NP gives a more accurate indication of the intensity and strain on the body of these training sessions. When the average power quickly rises and falls (e.g. between two intervals), the NP will decrease less rapidly in this case because the variation in power (intervals) will be included in the formula. With this calculation it is possible to get a better indication of how heavy the interval training was. The calculation of normalized power is quite complicated and sometimes not well understood. Often you can hear riders say ‘the NP calculation filters out the moments when your power was zero’ or ‘the NP is the power you need to deliver to ride at a constant speed’. Both assumptions are wrong.\nNP formula trademark.\nTo calculate the NP you have to do the following: calculate a 30-second moving average of the power data, increase this value to the fourth power, take the average of these values and calculate the root to the fourth power. The result of this is the 30-second moving average power, this is the actual definition of normalized power. Now you can forget about the calculation of normalized power. The only important thing to remember is that it is a mathematical approach to express the variation in power. Many training parameters are based on NP instead of average power. The whole performance management chart, for example, is based on NP. Also the intensity factor (IF) and training stress score (TSS) are based on NP.\nNP is often used to indicate the intensity of a prescribed training. Especially when you do intervals above your FTP, the average power of a workout can be low, but NP and therefore TSS will still be quite high because it is a better representation of the intensity of the workout. NP can best be used for the analysis afterwards, it gives a good insight into how heavy the training or competition was.\nFinally, you may have noticed the little ‘r’ behind normalized power. This stands for a registered trademark, which means that this term and the way it is calculated is owned by TrainingsPeaks and its mother company (Peaksware). For this reason Strava, the training platform Today’s Plan and others, have developed their own value. Not only the name but also the calculation is slightly different from TrainingPeaks’ NP. But the idea and the principle are the same. It may be that you encounter a small difference between these values, but that is not a problem. You can interpret these values in exactly the same way.\nHow to get better?\nGetting better is all about timing. There are actually no good or bad workouts. There is only a bad combination or the wrong workout at the wrong time. The path towards progress is therefore a training plan with the right training stimulus that takes into account your level, goals and available time. To help you with that we developed an algorithm in the EnduroCo Cycling application. It provides you with a highly flexible training plan that takes into account your level, goals and availability, and makes sure that you get the most out of your rides. You can download EnduroCo in the App Store and Play store. Or check this page for more information."

    "content": "The Intensity Factor (IF) is a very useful indicator. This article explains why it is so useful and how to interpret the number. Let’s first look at how it is calculated. The intensity factor is obtained by dividing the NP (Normalized Power) by the FTP (Functional Threshold Power). The result should be somewhere between 0.6 (very long or slow rides) and 1.2 (short and very intensive rides).\nNormalized Power\nBecause it is based on Normalized Power and not on average power, it takes into account the variation in power during a workout. But it does not look at the length of the ride which means that it is not affected by, for example, muscle fatigue during a long ride (which can cause a distorted picture). Unlike the Training stress score (TSS), the intensity factor really shows how intensive a workout was. A TSS of 100 can be a very long endurance ride of three hours or an all-out time trial of one hour at FTP.\nThe importance of the intensity factor becomes clear when you start training as effectively as possible. Effective training means that every training session contributes towards your goal. When you know what is needed to achieve your goal, it is also clear how to train for it. By evaluating the intensity factor (in combination with other factors) of your training you can analyze whether you have achieved the intended training effect. And by knowing if you have completed the right training you know if you are on the right track to achieve your goal.\nHow to use the intensity factor?\nThis might sound a little abstract. So let’s show you some, real life, typical intensity factor values. An intensity factor lower than 0.65 means you did a recovery ride to ensure that the muscles recover actively after a heavy training session. Endurance rides to improve your stamina usually score between 0.65 and 0.85. Tempo zone training sessions (where fat burning is maximal and a lot of energy is generated from carbohydrates) will see readings between 0.85 and 0.90 are tempo training sessions This zone is often called the ‘sweet spot zone’. Between 0.95 and 1.05 we are talking FTP-intensity workouts, i.e. an all-out workout on a long climb, time trial or criterium of 20 minutes to an hour. Above 1.05 are short intensive workouts like a prologue or a short steep climb. Let’s go back to effective training. If you want to ride a cyclosportive like La Marmotte, you have to climb 5000 altitude meters and ride 175 kilometers. This will easily see a lot of people take 8 hours to complete, so it is obvious that their endurance needs to be well developed. A high FTP is not essential in this case because riding an hour at the FTP-level will not bring you to the finish but only halfway through the first climb!\nSo what do you pay attention to when you evaluate your training or make a plan? You will have to do a lot of endurance training sessions at an intensity factor between 0,75 and 0,85. If you train with a higher or lower IF you train either too heavy or too light and not effectively.\nHaving said that, you’ll always have to remember not to train too monotonously. The body adapts best when the training stimulus is neither too heavy nor too light. If you always train the same thing, the effectiveness of that training gradually decreases. Also mentally it is tiring to always do the same training. So always keep training with at least some variation. The intensity factor is your best friend who helps you keep an eye on that.\nHow to get better?\nGetting better is all about timing. There are actually no good or bad workouts. There only is a bad combination or the wrong workout at the wrong time. The path towards progress is therefore a training plan with the right training stimulus, taking into account your level, goal and available time."

    "content": "Power:\nDefinition: Power is a physical quantity of energy per unit of time. The unit of power is Watt or joules per second.\nExplanation: It’s the most valid and reliable way to measure your performance. It’s the direct energy output that you provide. In addition, it is also the best way to determine the intensity of a training exercise on your body. But don’t just look at the power number, never forget to listen to your body and how you feel before, during and after a workout.\n\t\n\t\tNormalized power:\nDefinition: Average power based on an algorithm that takes into account the fact that you do not provide constant power (the average power) while cycling.\nExplanation: Normalized power is calculated by averaging the variation in power over various time intervals. The average power of an interval training would be lower because of the rest you take in between the intervals. The normalized power takes this variation in the intervals into account. This makes it a more accurate way to determine the intensity of a training session. A ride with a lot of variation (intervals or height difference) with the same average power as a constant workout is harder on the body and would be reflected by a higher normalized power number.\n\t\n\t\tIntensity Factor (Intensity factor, IF):\nDefinition: The intensity factor is a measure of the average intensity of a workout.\nExplanation: The intensity factor is obtained by dividing the normalized power (NP) by the FTP (Functional Threshold Power). The result gives an indication of the hardness of the workout. This means that a ride at your FTP gives an IF of 1.00. The IF is a simple indication of the intensity of the workout and can prevent you from training too monotonously. Try to avoid always coming home with the same IF.\n\t\n\t\tTraining Stress Score (TSS):\nDefinition: A score to determine the stress that a workout puts on the body, which is based on the intensity (intensity factor, IF) and the duration of a ride.\nExplanation: The heavier and longer a ride, the higher the TSS will be. For example: a ride of one hour at your FTP will lead to a TSS of 100. A very quiet endurance training (IF of 0.50) of two hours can therefore result in the same TSS. This implies that you should not only look at the TSS, but also at other indicators (IF, NP and duration). The same TSS does not imply the same training effect!\n\t\n\t\tKcal (kilocalorie):\nDefinition: A unit for energy, just like Joule.\nExplanation: Calories is actually an old expression, but it is still widely used in the food industry. One calorie equals 4.18 KJ. The mechanical efficiency during cycling is about 20%. That means that you need to produce five times as much energy from food to keep on cycling. With this knowledge it is possible to calculate exactly how much energy you need based on your power data (power is after all joules per second).\n\t\n\t\tFTP: \nDefinition: Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is the maximum power you can just sustain for one hour.\nExplanation: The FTP is determined through an exercise test in a lab. You can also do a DIY field test to get a fairly good indication of it (20 minutes test). After a field test, you should take the average power value that you got after going all out for 20 minutes and take 5% off to have a good estimate of your FTP. Physiologically speaking, the FTP corresponds with the point where the production and consumption of lactate are in balance. When the intensity is higher than the FTP, you won’t be able to maintain it for very long, because not all the lactate can be burned any more. Your legs will notice. An intensity just below or at the FTP-level can be maintained much longer. The FTP can be expressed in both absolute power (Watt) and relative power (Watt/kg) by taking a person’s body weight into the equation. That latter, relative power is especially important when pointing your bike up mountain roads.\n\t\n\t\tTraining zones:\nDefinition: A distribution based on power and/or heart rate to determine the degree of intensity.\nExplanation: Power and heart rate zones are based on your FTP or your threshold heart rate. The reason why training zones are used is to determine and evaluate the intensity of a workout in order to achieve the intended training effect. Because it is actually impossible to keep your power or heart rate constant, training sessions are based on zones.\n\t\n\t\tERG mode:\nDefinition: A setting where the smart-trainer controls your power by adjusting the resistance to your cadence.\nExplanation: The ERG mode is ideal for carrying out specific training sessions. In this mode the bike ascertains that you are pushing the desired power (e.g. a certain percentage of your FTP). If you keep can your cadence constant, the indoor bicycle trainer will do the rest!"

    "content": "This is an important question that is not very easy to answer. Several factors play a role at both power and heart rate.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe problem with heart rate.\n\n\nWhen the heart rate monitor was introduced for consumer use, the main goal was to increase the training efficiency. By measuring the heart rate, you got a much better idea of the impact and intensity of a workout on the body. In the era before the heart rate monitor, speed was used an an indicator of the intensity of a ride. This is obviously a very inaccurate way to determine the intensity because external circumstances play a major role. However, heart rate is also an indirect way of measuring the intensity of a workout. Heart rate is the body’s response to an effort. If this reaction is always the same, then heart rate would reflect the intensity of a workout perfectly. But it turns out that a large number of factors can influence the heart rate. Examples include stress, caffeine, altitude, recovery, sleep and time of day. All these factors affect your heart rate.\nWe explain this a little further. We take as an example a rider with an FTP of 250 W. When this rider cycles at a power of 200 W, this is below his maximum lactate steady state (MLSS) and he can maintain this intensity for quite a long time. Now the same rider is at high altitude (2500 meters above sea level). Contrary to what many people think there is the same amount of oxygen in the air here, only the air pressure is lower so the oxygen uptake in the lungs is lower. This means that the body has to work harder to supply the muscles with the same amount of oxygen. For this reason his heart rate is higher at the same power, and because less oxygen reaches the muscles, his FTP at altitude is also lower. The same goes for fatigue (lower heart rate at the same intensity) or caffeine consumption (higher heart rate).\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe effect of blood volume on heart rate.\n\nThis example is fairly easy to understand, but there are more examples of factors that can throw the relationship between power and heart rate out of whack. For example, if you haven’t cycled for a while, your heart rate is probably high during the first few rides. Put differently, riding at a high intensity feels quite easy. This is because you are completely fresh and rested, but also because your blood volume decreases rapidly after not training for a few days. Due to the lower blood volume, your heart has to pump harder to deliver the same amount of blood to your muscles. Does this mean that heartbeat is totally worthless and that you should only look at power to determine the intensity of a workout? No, certainly not!\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe body’s response to exercise.\n\nThe beauty of training with a heart rate monitor is that it is an objective way to measure the body’s response to exercise. Combining heart rate and power is a good method to see what your body does (power) and how your body reacts to it (heart rate). It gets even better if your feeling during a workout matches the numbers that appear on your bike computer! When you do an extensive endurance training, your heart rate is higher than normal and you don’t feel great? It could be that there is an illness lurking. Or maybe you have eaten too little or drank too much coffee. But if your heart rate is a bit higher than normal and you haven’t trained for a few days it could mean that you are well rested.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\nLooking at power and heart rate.\n\nThe combination of power, heart rate and your feeling gives the complete picture. Even power can vary due to the environment and conditions on the day. When all external factors are the same, such as your weekly indoor workout one hour after dinner, it gives you a reliable way to measure your workout load and see if you’ve made any progress. Be aware that your FTP will not change much from day to day. Don’t get tempted into upping the intensity of a training session when your heart rate is a bit lower than usual. Of course, it could be a sign of progress if you see a lower heart rate at the same power level, but it may also be due to other factors. The same goes for a higher heart rate at a certain power. As soon as you notice over a longer period of time that you can deliver more power at a certain heart rate, we can assume that this is a positive effect of training. But check if there is an upward trend in your workouts and don’t be fooled by a single workout in which you had a higher/lower heart rate at a certain power level. Heart rate can’t be compared 1-on-1 with power, so don’t jump to conclusions and always listen to your body."

    "content": "What is FTP?\nNo bicycle race on television goes by without the commentators talking about FTP or power. More and more training plans are based on power. Maybe your training buddy just bought a power meter. As a cyclist you can’t ignore it, these days it’s all about power in cycling and often in the same sentence the expression FTP is used. Why do you need to look at power (and therefore a power meter)? In this article you will learn about the advantages of training with a power meter, knowing your FTP and how to improve.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTraining load monitoring\nA power meter is simply the best way to determine the training load. In the past, when athletes and cyclists wanted to monitor their training load, they started to do so in speed (km/h) and/or in time. But as you probably know, your speed is influenced by wind, temperature, altitude, etc. So speed is not the best way to analyze a training session or to monitor the training load.\nThe heart rate monitor was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s. A beautiful development, as the environment and circumstances have a much smaller influence on it. By measuring the heart rate, scientists and coaches thought they could measure exactly how hard your body actually works during a training session. But the knowledge about training grew and the heart rate turned out to be rather variable. It is influenced by factors such as temperature, altitude, stress, fatigue and fluctuates from day to day. Drinking a cup of coffee can boost your heart rate, while the training session doesn’t get any harder. So the heart rate as a valid and reliable way to measure training load was quickly questioned. As a result, the search for another way to determine the training load was embarked upon. If the heart rate had proved to be a valid and reliable way, the power meter would probably never have been invented. The power meter was introduced in the early 1990s. Lance Armstrong was one of the first professional cyclists to use a power meter to monitor his training load.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tP=F*v.\nWhat is power anyway? In mechanics, the formula is power: Power = Force x Speed (P=F*v). This means on a bike; the force on your pedals multiplied by the distance your pedals cover (measured as cadence). Power is a direct measure of your output, which is not influenced by external factors. Power instead of heart rate is also capable of monitoring improvement. As you improve, the power you can produce over a certain time interval will improve. This is not possible if you use speed or heart rate, your heart rate and speed could be the same while you are delivering more power.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFunctional Threshold Power / FTP.\nSo with power, we can finally see what you’re really doing. In order to have a good idea of how heavy a certain exercise is for you personally, or to be able to make a good training schedule, we use training zones. There are different ways to classify the power zones. In the EnduroCo Cycling app, we use five zones based on your FTP. Your FTP can be determined by doing an exercise test. An exercise test shows you what you are good at and in what areas you can improve the most: it gives you insight into your aerobic and anaerobic threshold. A slightly less accurate way to determine your FTP is through a DIY, 20-minute test that you do on your indoor trainer or out on the road. This is actually a time trial of 20 minutes preceded by a good warm-up. 95% of the average power over those 20 minutes is a good estimate of your FTP.\nOften the FTP power is divided by your weight, so you get a relative power in Watts per kilogram. This is a good way to bring the important role that your weight plays into the equation. That matters a lot with climbing. But in a sprint, on the other hand, it’s the absolute, raw power that counts!\nDidm’t you do a proper FTP test yet, or do you not have a power meter and do you still want an indication of your FTP? Then calculate your FTP based on your speed with our unique FTP calculator.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPower meters.\nPower meters are getting cheaper and cheaper. The most reliable power meters are the ones that sit in your bottom bracket or in advanced indoor smart trainers. Most power meters promise an accuracy of +/- 2%, with the smart trainers this is only +/- 1%. Power meters can also be in the crank or in your pedals and when power is measured on both sides they can show the balance between right and left. Some power meters only measure left, a cheaper alternative, but not the most reliable.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHow to get better.\nGetting better is all about timing. There are actually no good or bad workouts. There is only a bad combination or the wrong workout at the wrong time. The path to progress is therefore a training plan with the right training stimulus, taking into account your level, goal and available time. To help you with that we developed an algorithm in the EnduroCo Cycling application. It provides you with a highly flexible and personalized training plan to make sure that you make the most out of your rides.\nAfter reading how much you can improve your Functional Threshold Power (FTP; the power you can sustain for 60 minutes), it is equally important to know how you can realize that! In many cycling groups, the discussion quickly turns to someone’s FTP. It is considered the benchmark of someone’s cycling performance.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhy FTP?\nThe FTP appears to be seen as the true cyclist performance indicator and is linked to almost every discipline in cycling that takes 4 minutes or longer. It provides a real insight into someone’s aerobic metabolism and efficiency. We usually talk about the FTP in the context of power, but the heart rate at around the FTP level is called the threshold heart rate. So the power performance at the threshold heart rate is also the FTP. The FTP can be analyzed in 2 ways; namely in absolute terms (for example 300 W) or relative (for example 4 Watt/kg). Whereby the latter number is a good indicator for your speed on a climb. So the higher your FTP in terms of W/kg, the faster you will ride up the Alpe d’Huez. One kilogram less weight at the same power output can easily save you one minute on a climb of one hour. In this article we look at improving the absolute FTP. Obviously, you can even further increase the relative FTP by losing weight, but we save that part of the equation for another article.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhat is the best thing to do to improve my FTP\nTo Train! Actually, it is the simplest answer there is, but also true: as long as you get off the couch and jump on the bike you will start improving your FTP. In fact, there is basically no “bad” training to improve the FTP. Everything the aerobic system uses during training is basically a stimulus for the body. Of course, it is true that certain workouts and combinations of different workouts work better if you are looking to improve your FTP. In the past, people thought that training at the threshold heart rate/FTP would improve the FTP. So they did a lot of very hard workouts. But this also caused a lot of fatigue and often only a small increase in the FTP. In order to know which training sessions are the best, it is important to look at the various different elements of the performance at the threshold heart rate or FTP.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPhysiological components of the FTP point\nPhysiologically speaking, the FTP is the point at which the production and the breakdown of lactate are just about in balance still. In scientific literature this is also called the Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS). This means there is acidification, but it is kept under control and therefore sustainable over a longer period of time. Looking at the internal factors that determine FTP, there are actually three:\nVO2max: the maximum aerobic capacity. This intensity can only be maintained for 4-8 minutes as lactate production is much higher than breakdown of it. This forms the ceiling of your aerobic efforts.\nFTP as a percentage of VO2max: the equilibrium of the lactate production/breakdown. At untrained riders this will be around 50%, while pro riders in the Tour de France can hit 90%.\nEfficiency: how much power your body can release per liter of oxygen at the turning point. A high VO2max is of course nice, but if your body is not very efficient you will not notice much of it when you are out on the road.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTraining to improve the FTP\nNow that we know out of which 3 components the FTP consists, we want to train them individually. Below we indicate which type of training is specific to these three components. Not entirely in random order!\nThe long endurance training: endurance training in which the length of the training mainly determines the effect. Riding harder during your endurance training therefore makes little sense; it only brings more fatigue while it does not strengthen the stimulus itself. Because the muscles are continuously loaded during your endurance training, this is a very strong stimulus for the aerobic system, as it ensures an increase of the mitochondria (energy factories) in the muscles. The more mitochondria you have (and the better they function) the higher your VO2max, but also the better the body is at buffering the lactate that is being generated while exercising. So the long ride increases your VO2max, improves efficiency and, most importantly, increases the FTP as a percentage of your VO2max.\nThreshold: or long intervals (95-105% FTP). These long intervals (4-15 minutes) at or just above the threshold provide a specific stimulus for the FTP. They really make you better at tolerating and breaking down the lactic acid created by training at a high percentage of the VO2max. The problem with these stimuli is that they are also very tiring and therefore should not be done very often.\nVO2max: or short intervals (105-120% FTP). These short intervals (2-5 min) are especially effective for improving the VO2max itself, so they help to lift the threshold levels. During the short intervals you are really at the limit of your aerobic system.\nTempo/Sweetspot intervals: long blocks below the threshold. Because the intensity is below the threshold, around 85-95% FTP, the body remains in a steady state. This makes it easier to spend more time at a relatively high percentage of VO2max. If you also execute these intervals at a somewhat lower cadence, this is a very good stimulus that will ensure an increase in efficiency.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tConclusion\nThere are many different ways that help to improve your FTP. Basically you can pick between two different approaches. The traditional method combines relatively frequent tempo and threshold training sessions, while the ‘modern’ approach mixes mainly long, steady endurance training with short, intense Vo2max training. This ‘new’ method is also called polarized training and you can read more about it in this article. Both approaches work and what is the best one for you depends on your training history and your goals. As mentioned earlier, there are several roads that lead to Rome. The most important thing is to see which aspect is the one where you can improve the most. You can find this out by properly mapping out your performance, for example by doing an exercise test."

That is a pity, because sub-optimal nutrition affects your performance. Allow us to explain the basic principles of a good nutritional strategy, so what to eat and drink before, during and after your bike rides.\nWhat do you need for optimal performance.\nYou go out on a bike ride regularly and maybe you even monitor your training load. You might even follow a training plan. Everything done correctly, right? Well maybe, because a lot of cyclists forget the nutritional strategy. That is a pity, because sub-optimal nutrition affects your performance. Allow us to explain the basic principles of a good nutritional strategy, so what to eat and drink before, during and after your bike rides.\nWhat do you need for optimal performance?\nNutrition means fuel (calories) and nutrients, which are both needed for optimal performance and even the prevention of injuries. As a cyclist, your daily intake of food and liquids can be split into the three, well-known macro nutrients. It should consist of 6-10 grams per kilogram of body weight of carbohydrates, 1.5-2.0 gram/kg body weight of protein and 20 % of total calories intake through fat. In general, your daily intake should include 200-300 grams of vegetables, at least 2 pieces of fruit, whole grain cereal products, dairy (substitutes), meat (substitutes), nuts and seeds, 1.5 liters of water/tea, fats like olive oil and enough sunlight or vitamin D3 supplements. Your weekly diet also needs to include fat fish, vegetables and peas. Alcohol negatively affects your immune system and reduces the protein synthesis during the recovery phase after a strenuous exercise and is therefore not recommended.\nHow much carbohydrates do you need?\nCarbohydrates and protein are key in optimizing performance and recovery. Carbohydrates are stored in your muscles, liver and blood in the form of glycogen and are used when exercising. Depending on the duration of the effort you need to replenish this stock. To top off glycogen stores 3-4 hours prior to a hard exercise, a carbohydrate rich meal (200-300 gram, simple carbohydrates) can be consumed. For efforts up to 60 minutes, there are enough carbohydrates in stock in your body, so you don’t need to consume any extra. However, a drink with some fast carbohydrates will never hurt your performance. For efforts between 1 hour and 2.5 hour exercise, 45-60 grams/hour is usually sufficient. For exercises lasting more than 2.5 hours up to 90 grams/hour of glucose/maltodextrin and fructose (in a 2:1 ratio!) is needed. This ratio is important, because when the transporter proteins for glucose in the intestines are saturated, the fructose transporters are still available, partly the reason that explains this larger carbohydrate uptake.\nTiming of carbohydrate intake.\nThere are many strategies for improving performance by (temporarily) omitting carbohydrates from the diet, but to start, you should be able to handle the 90 gram/hour intake without any gastrointestinal distress. Because, in the end, that is what your body needs during a race or a cyclosportive. In general, the higher the quality and volume of the training, the more extreme the environmental conditions (hot, cold, altitude), the more important the supply of carbohydrates becomes. Consuming enough carbs during and post exercise is essential to replenish the glycogen stores, facilitate fast recovery and reduce the impaired immune response. 1.0-1.5 gram/kg body weight of carbs is sufficient in the first half hour after exercise. This can be repeated every two hours over the next 4-6 hours.\nHow much protein do you need?\nProtein consists of essential, partly-essential and non-essential amino acids. Your diet needs to be varied and should therefore contain the essential amino-acids, because the body is not able to create them itself. Your body can only fully recover and facilitate metabolic adaptations with a positive protein balance. It is recommended to consume your total daily protein needs in 6 little portions of 0.25-0.3 gram/kg body weight. The older you get, the more protein you need, up to 0.4 gram/kg body weight. Longer bike rides of 4 hours or more may, in addition, also require ~5 grams/hour protein intake, to replenish the protein that has been used along the way. Post exercise, 1 dairy-based protein portion needs to be consumed within the first hour. Dairy is rich in casein and whey, that both consist of all the 9 essential amino acids and have proven to be the best muscle adaptation facilitators. Optimally, you consume something rich in whey within half an hour after exercise and something rich in casein before you go to bed. By doing so, the faster digestion and absorption kinetics of whey optimize a fast recovery, while the ‘slower’ casein facilitates optimal muscle synthesis during the night. So take that bowl of cottage cheese/quark\nWhat is good hydration?\nLast but not least: hydration. Your urine should be pale yellow. This means in general that you should drink 0,5-1L per hour when exercising, preferably not plain water but isotonic sports drinks. This helps to replenish the electrolyte losses and also deliver some of the needed carbohydrates. However, if your stomach isn’t used to these kinds of volumes yet, the advice is to practice this in training. When your post-workout urine runs too dark, then you haven’t drunk enough.\nTrain your gut.\nIn summary, start with the basics: make sure you have got your macronutrients dialed in in the right proportions. Thereafter, let your gut get used to the consumption of large quantities of carbohydrates and liquids during training. The biggest mistake we often see is that cyclists have not trained a proper fueling strategy but still expect the body to handle large amounts of carbohydrates come race day. After the finish, replenish your carbohydrates and protein stocks and don’t wait too long doing that! And just wait for a few hours before hitting that tempting, celebratory glass of beer or wine. Bon appetit!"

    "content": "Why use zones?\nWhat are the underlying physiological processes in the different zones? The body basically has three different energy systems to create ATP, which is the energy that is needed for muscle contractions and thus your ability to run or cycle. The systems are the creatine phosphate system, the anaerobic system and the aerobic system. The first is mainly used during a sprint and is exhausted after about 15 seconds of extreme exertion. After those 15 seconds, the anaerobic and aerobic systems take over.\nThe anaerobic system can generate a lot of energy in a short time but does not last very long and you have to adjust the intensity after that. The aerobic system uses mainly oxygen and fat as energy sources and is therefore the system that will deliver energy for the longest time. So for long efforts, like cycling, it is the most important energy system.\nOn the other hand, all energy systems will work side by side to release energy. Depending on the intensity of an effort, one system will work harder or less hard. At low intensity, almost all energy can be delivered by the aerobic system, but as the intensity increases, the anaerobic system is used more and more."

    "content": "Actually the answer to the first question is quite easy, but the second one requires a bit more explanation to answer. Let’s start with the easy one.\nBetter at stretching than bending\nBut as we all know force has two components of which direction is one, but what about the amount of force that is applied. Should the force be applied evenly in the same amount through the whole cycle? No, it simply should not. Because if you should, you should apply as much power to the down stroke as to the upstroke. But the human body is much better equipped to apply a lot of force in stretching the knee than in bending it. Also, if you apply force evenly through the whole pedal cycle there is never a moment of rest. This also doesn’t make sense because there is already a relatively large window of time in which a cyclist can apply force compared to the much shorter contact phase in other endurance sports like running and speed skating.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe different phases of the pedal stroke\nIf we use the analogy of a clock and define 12 o’clock as the pedal’s top position and 3 o’clock as the down phase, then we can distinguish 4 phases. From around 1 till 5 o’clock we are in the down stroke. From 5 till 7 o’clock a transition takes place towards the upstroke. 7 till 11 o’clock is the upstroke and finally from 11 till 1 is the transition to the down stroke again.\nBecause the pedal stroke describes a perfect circle (for the sake of this article we leave oval chainrings out of the picture), the force that is applied to the pedal should be pointing in the direction of the tangential force during the complete cycle. This might sound more difficult than it actually is. It basically means that if the pedal is at 3 o’clock the force on the pedal should be directed straight down, but one millisecond later just a little bit backwards. That way the force that is applied on the pedal always contributes 100% to the motion. So no energy gets lost by applying force in the wrong direction.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhat is the ideal force direction?\nNowadays, a lot of powermeters but also indoor trainers like the Tacx Neo II give you feedback on how much force is applied and in which direction. This gives us the opportunity to see how the most experienced cyclists and pro’s apply their force. Based on this, we see that professional riders are better at applying their force in the tangential direction than less experienced riders. By doing so there are less dead spots in the transitions from the upstroke to the down stroke and vice versa. Also the pro’s never, unless they find themselves on a very steep climb with an extremely low RPM, pull on their pedal. Instead they actively unload the pedal so the other leg doesn’t have to push against the weight of the passive leg.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDon’t pull on your pedals!\nActively pulling on the pedal is still one of the biggest myths still doing the rounds in the amateur cyclist scene. Research has found that an amateur should focus on the transitions around both the 12- and 6 o’clock-positions and make sure to push the pedal in the right direction. So if we know when and in which direction to apply the force, how can we train this? First and foremost, the biggest factor that might be in the way of a perfect pedal stroke is your bike position. If your saddle is too high the transition from the down stroke to the upstroke is seriously hindered and vice versa for a saddle that is too low.\nAlso the setback of your saddle (the saddle position relative to the bike’s bottom bracket) in relation to the length of some of your body parts and the length of the crank. If for example your saddle position is too much backwards and/or the cranklength is too long, it takes too much energy to apply force in the tangential direction and you will probably see a dead spot when pulling the pedal backwards. If the cranklength is too short the muscles will not be stretched to their optimal force-length ratio. So a proper bike fit that optimizes all these data points for you is a very wise investment to help you perfect your pedal stroke.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPro’s vs. recreational cyclists\nFurthermore, it is also a case of big numbers. The more hours you ride your bike, the better your body learns how to apply force in the most effective and efficient way without you even thinking about it. Varying your cadences and not always riding with the same 85-90 RPM also helps the body to train an effective coordination pattern. This is just another example of your body’s ability to know what’s going on, without you thinking about it all the time.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTrain your pedal stroke\nThis however doesn’t mean that feedback of what you’re doing isn’t useful. This can definitely speed up the learning process. If, for example, you clearly see there is a deadspot in the upward transition phase and you know the bike is properly set, you can try to push the pedal backwards actively. By doing so the body learns there is a better and more effective way of pedaling. Also a great exercise in this case are one leg drills. Just click one foot out of the pedal and use just one leg for about five minutes at the same RPM. Without the other leg helping, not having a fluent transition phase becomes immediately apparent. One last, very important factor to work on is your core. If your core muscles are too weak it is really difficult to have a stable and effective pedal stroke. To paraphrase it: you can’t fire a cannon from a canoe."

    "content": "Your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), or the anaerobic threshold, is often used as the measure of your fitness. FTP is the maximum power a person can produce over an hour. You can test, train and, above all, improve it. This power level, or your heart rate at your anaerobic threshold, are used to establish your training zones. Many cyclists aspire to increase their FTP in order to be able to ride harder, further, finish less tired and recover faster. Overall: to become a better rider. For these reasons, a higher FTP is the ultimate training goal for many cyclists. So how should you do that with polarized training?\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHow to improve your FTP\nIt would seem logical to train a lot at your FTP-level when you want to improve this value. But just training on your FTP is not the only and certainly not the best way to improve your FTP. To explain this we first need to step back and discuss a few basic principles from modern training theory.\nWhen the intensity of a workout increases, the body starts to use more of its anaerobic energy system. This is because the aerobic system cannot produce enough energy anymore to keep up with the rise in power. The use of anaerobic energy systems trigger a higher lactate production. Eventually, two lactate thresholds are hit: the first one is not your FTP, but the point where your lactate concentration starts rising above the resting value (often around 2 mmol of lactate). This point is called the aerobic threshold.\nThe second threshold is your FTP or anaerobic threshold. At this second point the production and absorption lactate are precisely in balance. Above it, there will be a surplus in lactate production which causes an athlete to hit the wall. In theory, the FTP is the maximum intensity you can hold for 60 minutes. In reality this is not entirely true and there are large individual differences in how long you can ride at your anaerobic threshold. We don’t want to make it too complicated right now and assume for now that your FTP is a good estimate of your anaerobic threshold.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3-zone model\nBased on these two thresholds, you can determine the 3-zone model. This model is often used in scientific studies to index the intensity. For example, the zones ‘below aerobic threshold’, ‘between aerobic and anaerobic threshold’ and ‘above anaerobic threshold’ are often used.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t80/20 rule for Polarized training\nIn several (retrospective) studies, some remarkable observations were made. Many elite endurance athletes (cyclists, runners, swimmers, rowers and cross-country skiers) do not often train on or around their FTP, i.e. high in the second zone. Instead, these pros often train with 80/20 rule for Polarized training, ‘polarized training distribution’. This means that they train a lot below their aerobic threshold (zone 1) and a lot above their anaerobic threshold (zone 3). So there is almost no training between the aerobic and anaerobic threshold. Almost 80% of the training was at low intensity (below the aerobic threshold) and 10 to 20% of the training was above the anaerobic threshold in the form of interval training. This does not mean that 10% to 20% of the total training time was done in zone 3, but rather that 10% to 20% of the number of training sessions contained zone-3 intervals.\nAs a result of these results, a lot of further research has been done into this method of classifying training sessions and its effectiveness. This was done for many different sports at all kinds of levels and yielded interesting results. Recreational cyclists also showed the most improvement in their FTP when they trained 6 hours per week in a polarized way, compared to training plans that spent more time in between the aerobic and anaerobic threshold.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBackground of Polarized training\nTo explain Polarized training may not even be that complicated. Training on your anaerobic threshold is very exhausting but you don’t use all your muscle groups at this intensity and you don’t get the maximum out of your heart/lung system. So you do get quite tired, but the training stimulus is less intensive than (shorter) cycling above your anaerobic threshold. That’s why it’s better to make sure you put a maximum load on the whole system and build up less fatigue, so you can do that more often. So, if you want to improve your FTP, it is very important that you look at the intensity of your workouts. Most recreational cyclists ride their easy rides too intensively but their hard rides are not done hard enough. Often because they are still tired from that easy ride that they did too hard! So train like a pro by doing polarized training!\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHow to get better?\nGetting better is all about timing. There are actually no good or bad workouts. There is only a bad combination or the wrong workout at the wrong time. The path towards progress is therefore a training plan with the right training stimuli at the right time, taking into account your level, goal and available time.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBeter Worden Podcast – Polarized training"
