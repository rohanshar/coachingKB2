# Milan-San Remo: The Ultimate Cycling Race

Milan-San Remo holds a special place on the cycling calendar as it is considered the official opening of the classic cycling season. This race spans across 300 kilometers of relatively flat plains along the river Po, with the real excitement packed into the final 30 kilometers. The last stretch of the race features two significant hills, the Cipressa and the Poggio, which come into play 30 kilometers before the finish. The summit of the Poggio is a mere 5 kilometers away from the finish line on via Roma, providing an opportunity for puncheurs/climbers to outsmart sprinters.

## Tactics for Success

To succeed in this race, contenders must conserve their energy for hours on end, while their teammates ensure that their top riders expend as little energy as possible until they reach the Poggio. At that point, it becomes the responsibility of a sprinter to match the pace set by the puncheurs/climbers. The success of this strategy depends on how fresh the riders are when they reach the foot of the Poggio, as the grueling 290 kilometers leading up to it can significantly impact their fitness. In cycling, it's not just about how fast you can perform a single feat, but how well you can sustain it over the course of the race. The cyclist who experiences the least deterioration often ends up on the podium.

## The Misleading Metrics

Focusing solely on metrics like Functional Threshold Power (FTP), which measures the maximum power sustained for up to an hour, or Power Profile (PP), which indicates the best power output across various time durations, can be misleading. While these values provide insights into a cyclist's abilities, they may not accurately represent their performance in certain situations.

## Understanding Aerobic Decoupling

Aerobic decoupling (AD) offers a measure to evaluate the extent of deterioration or the development of aerobic endurance. AD compares the relationship between heart rate and power during the first half of a workout with the second half. The difference between the two halves is expressed as a percentage. A higher percentage suggests a significant increase in heart rate during the second half at the same power levels, indicating substantial deterioration.

## Decoding the Numbers

When comparing aerobic decoupling numbers, it's crucial to consider certain factors. Dehydration, lack of hydration, hot weather, and inadequate nutrition can greatly impact these numbers. Additionally, a training session must be at least 2 hours long to effectively compare both halves. Furthermore, the intensity distribution should be similar between the first and second halves for a meaningful comparison.

For instance, if you want to track improvements in aerobic decoupling from week to week, compare two training sessions that are relatively similar in terms of conditions and training load. The goal should be to achieve a decoupling below 5% for endurance training sessions lasting 2 to 4 hours. The ultimate test would be to maintain this level of decoupling over the 300 kilometers of Milan-San Remo, but by then, you will likely be competing in the professional peloton.
