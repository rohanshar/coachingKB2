The world of cycling is a fascinating and complex world with a rich history. Whether you are a amateur cyclist or simply interested in the sport, there is always something to discover and learn about the history and background of cycling. A great way to increase your knowledge of the world of cycling is by reading the best books on cycling.

But where do you start looking? There are thousands of books written about cycling, ranging from autobiographies of famous cyclists to historical analyses of the sport (based on scientific research and/or experience) and travel reports of famous cycling races. Therefore, it can be a challenge to find the right book that matches your interest and level.

How and where to find books about cycling

A good place to start is online bookstores. Major retailers like Amazon offer a wide range of cycling books, making it easy to search for authors, titles, and subjects. Smaller specialized bookstores, such as De Muur and Cyclostyle, also offer an extensive range of cycling books. Moreover, these bookstores can often recommend books based on your interest and level.

Another source of cycling books are libraries. Many libraries have a selection of books about cycling in their collection, and as a library member, you can borrow these books for free. Additionally, you can often search for books on specific topics on the library’s website and then reserve them.

Finally, there is the option to buy second-hand books. On websites like Thriftbooks, BookFinder.com and wob.com, you can often find cycling books at a lower price than the original retail price. The downside is that you do not always have the guarantee that the book is in good condition, but if you are willing to take that risk, it is certainly an option to consider.
