  In 2010, CycloWorld was established after a discussion on a cycling forum. It originated from a modest compilation of a few European cyclos suitable for road biking.

In 2019, we started our own **CycloWorld de Podcast**. It’s not just another cycling podcast, as it focuses exclusively on cycling events and not, for example, professional cycling. Regularly, well-known guests join us to take various subjects of experience from different angles as inspiration. For example, EnduroCo founder Jim van den Berg is a guest in episode #36, with the subject: **Building up training for the new season**.

Cycling enthusiasts don’t just ride around in circles: their goal is to get a little better every ride. Riding a cyclo or a long touring ride doesn’t just happen by itself. And that’s exactly where EnduroCo and CycloWorld found each other. Both platforms are aimed at **fanatical cycling tourists** who want to get the best out of themselves and discover the world by bike.
