In 2019, we started our own CycloWorld de Podcast. It’s not just another cycling podcast, as it focuses exclusively on cycling events and not, for example, professional cycling. Regularly, well-known guests join us to take various subjects of experience from different angles as inspiration. For example, EnduroCo founder Jim van den Berg is a guest in episode #36, with the subject: Building up training for the new season.Cycling enthusiasts don’t just ride around in circles: their goal is to get a little better every ride. Riding a cyclo or a long touring ride doesn’t just happen by itself. And that’s exactly where EnduroCo and CycloWorld found each other. Both platforms are aimed at fanatical cycling tourists who want to get the best out of themselves and discover the world by bike.
