# Science and VO2max

Science has been searching for ways to estimate VO2max without the need for a laboratory setup. It was previously believed that VO2max was not easily trainable and therefore served as a reliable predictor of sports talent. This article provides more information on VO2max and its significance.

## Calculation Methods

There are two main approaches to calculate VO2max:

1. **Maximum Effort:** This method involves performing a 5 max all-out effort on a bike to determine VO2max.
2. **Submaximal Effort:** This method utilizes formulas such as the Astrand Nomogram or the First Beat calculation commonly found in Garmin devices. These calculations estimate VO2max based on submaximal effort, heart rate, and power or running speed ratios.

The first method is considered the most accurate after direct laboratory measurements. By measuring maximum output and calculating the energy required, the correlation between a person's maximum 5-minute value and VO2max can be determined. This approach avoids the need for standard corrections based on age and gender, minimizing errors. However, it does rely on assumptions about efficiency and technique. Nonetheless, these formulas generally explain around 95% of the variance, which is acceptable in terms of margin of error. 

To determine your VO2max based on cycling power number, you can use the calculator provided on this page.

For those who prefer not to exert maximum effort, there are calculations that rely on power or running speed ratios and maximum heart rate values. These formulas extrapolate the ratio and apply corrections for age and gender. The Astrand's nomogram, developed in 1954, is a well-known method that predicts VO2max using a simple submaximal test. This method has been improved and validated over the past 60 years and still provides reasonably accurate values. A graph of the nomogram has been converted into a formula, which can be used with the calculator provided in the link below.

## Garmin Calculation

Garmin devices use an updated version of the Astrand method from 1954 to calculate VO2max. However, the exact method and correction factors for age and gender are undisclosed. At least 20 minutes of power data with a heart rate of 70% or higher of maximum heart rate are required for this calculation. While the accuracy of this method is said to be high, it has not undergone extensive scientific validation. The reported accuracy of the measurement is approximately 95% in running and 92% in cycling. These values allow for predicting and tracking Vo2max during training sessions.

## Concluding Thoughts

The question remains as to what exactly VO2max indicates about a person's cycling abilities. It may be beneficial to extrapolate the values to maximum power or running speeds to avoid discrepancies in standardized corrections for age and gender. Additionally, power outputs can be used to determine appropriate workout intensities, whereas VO2max values may have limited practical applications.
