## Tips for motorpacing trainingsessions

1) A motorpacing training session is not easy. The speed is high and in the busy Dutch traffic this can cause dangerous situations. Both the cyclist and the person driving the moped should be experienced in this part. In doing so, choose a quiet environment to complete the training sessions.


2) The exhaust fumes from a moped contain particulate matter. Not ideal for an athleteâ€™s lungs. So make sure the moped has a proper exhaust to minimize the inhalation of particulate matter.


3) Train at a high intensity and in intervals. The goal is to increase power at your FTP. By training in intervals and recovering from them in between, you will be able to push the speed even higher.


4) Play with the motor. A motor is an ideal opponent since, provided there is enough fuel, it will always win from you. This allows you to simulate race situations.
