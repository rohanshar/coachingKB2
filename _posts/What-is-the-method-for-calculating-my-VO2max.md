Throughout history, the field of science has been searching for alternative methods to assess VO2max without the need for a laboratory setup. It is worth noting that 50 years ago, it was believed that VO2max had limited potential for improvement and therefore served as a reliable predictor of athletic talent. This article delves into the topic further and provides an in-depth understanding of VO2max.


## 

## There are essentially two approaches to consider when calculating VO2max.

## 

The first method involves measuring maximum effort, such as a 5-minute all-out exertion on a bicycle. The accuracy of this approach is second only to direct laboratory measurements. By determining the maximum output and calculating the corresponding energy expenditure, it is possible to establish a strong correlation between a person's maximum 5-minute value and their VO2max. This method eliminates the need for age and gender corrections, reducing potential errors. However, it does require assumptions about efficiency and technique in cycling or running. Nevertheless, these formulas typically account for around 95% of the variance, which is generally acceptable in terms of margin of error.

On this page, you can find a calculator that allows you to determine your VO2max based on your cycling power number.


## 

Alternatively, there are calculations that do not require maximum effort. These calculations typically involve ratios of power or running speed to maximum heart rate values. These formulas extrapolate the ratios and apply corrections for age and gender. One well-known approach is Astrand's nomogram from 1954, which utilizes a line drawn between heart rate and power output during a submaximal test to predict VO2max. This method has undergone numerous improvements and validations over the past six decades, consistently yielding reasonable values. Thankfully, this graph has been converted into a formula, which can be utilized through the calculator provided in the link below.

Garmin devices employ a method that is essentially an updated version of Astrand's method from 1954. Unfortunately, Garmin's exact method remains undisclosed. The specific correction factors for age and gender, as well as the formula for extrapolating heart rate and power, are unknown. However, we do know that this calculation requires a minimum of 20 minutes of power data with a heart rate equal to or exceeding 70% of the maximum heart rate. While this method is considered relatively accurate, it has not been extensively validated in scientific research. The reported accuracy of this measurement is 95% for running and 92% for cycling. These figures are impressive and enable predictions of VO2max to be made during almost every training session.


## 

In conclusion, the question remains as to what exactly VO2max signifies in terms of a person's cycling capabilities and why it is not extrapolated to maximum power values or running speeds. By avoiding standardized corrections for age and gender, discrepancies can be minimized. Additionally, power outputs can be utilized to determine appropriate intensity levels for future workouts, whereas VO2max values have limited practical applications.
