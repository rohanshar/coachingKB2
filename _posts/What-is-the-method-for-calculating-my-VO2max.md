# Science and VO2max

Science has been searching for ways to estimate VO2max without the need for a laboratory setup. Previously, it was believed that VO2max was not easily trainable and thus served as a significant predictor of sports talent. This article provides more information on this topic and explains what exactly VO2max is.

## Calculation Methods

There are two main approaches to calculate VO2max:

1. **Maximum Effort:** This method involves performing a 5 max all-out effort on a bike. It is considered the most accurate method after direct laboratory measurements. By measuring the maximum output and calculating the energy required, one can determine a person's VO2max. This method does not require age and gender corrections, but assumptions regarding efficiency and technique are made. Despite this, the formulas used in this method explain approximately 95% of the variance, which is generally acceptable in terms of margin of error.

2. **Submaximal Effort:** This approach involves using formulas that extrapolate the ratio of power or running speed to maximum heart rate values. Corrections for age and gender are applied in these calculations. The Astrand Nomogram from 1954 is a well-known method for predicting VO2max using a line drawn between heart rate and power output during a submaximal test. This method has been improved and validated over the years. A formula based on the nomogram is also available for easy calculation.

## Garmin Calculation

Garmin devices use an updated version of the Astrand method from 1954 to estimate VO2max. However, the exact method and correction factors for age and gender are not disclosed by Garmin. To perform this calculation, at least 20 minutes of power data with a heart rate of 70% of maximum heart rate or higher is required. While this method is considered accurate, it lacks extensive scientific validation. The accuracy of this measurement is reported to be 95% in running and 92% in cycling.

## Conclusion

The value of VO2max in assessing a person's cycling capabilities remains a question. Alternatively, extrapolating to maximum power values or running speeds could avoid discrepancies in standardized corrections for age and gender. Power outputs can also be utilized to determine appropriate training intensities. VO2max calculators based on scientific evidence are available for reference.
