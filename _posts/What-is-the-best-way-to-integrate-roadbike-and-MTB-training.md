# Combining MTB and Roadbike Training

Many road cyclists who occasionally ride MTB or MTB riders who occasionally ride on the roadbike encounter difficulties in comparing the intensity of their training sessions. So, how can MTB and roadbike training be combined in one training schedule?

## Differences in Training Effort

It is important to realize that a workout on the MTB is very different from an effort on the road bike. On the road bike, power is mainly delivered below the threshold with a constant pressure on the pedals and a cadence between 80 and 100 rpm. This results in an aerobic energy supply, primarily utilizing slow muscle fibers that depend on oxygen and fat. The force per pedal rotation remains relatively constant, allowing for compensation of delays in heart rate fluctuations.

On the other hand, MTB training involves short, intense efforts or keeping the legs (almost) completely still. These efforts heavily rely on powerful fast muscle fibers and are short and anaerobic. Power output is more volatile, and the corresponding heart rate lags behind. Therefore, heart rate alone is not a reliable indicator of the effort's intensity.

## MTB & Interval Workout

Structured interval training on the MTB is practically impossible. Even short micro intervals of 40 seconds are challenging to execute consistently due to the need for consistent rest intervals. However, incorporating MTB training once a week can be a beneficial addition for a road cyclist with a goal on the road. For example, completing two sets of 20 minutes of hard effort on a challenging MTB track can serve as an excellent (unstructured) interval workout. It is important to limit MTB training for road cyclists since the effort and training effect differ too much from their road cycling goals.

On the other hand, for an MTB rider with a goal on the MTB, incorporating one or two aerobic endurance training sessions a week helps improve the basic condition. However, excessive endurance training on the road may hinder the necessary strength and explosiveness required for MTB riding. It's worth noting that endurance training for goals like the Transalp requires more volume compared to a cross country race.

## MTB and Roadbike with a Powermeter

Using a power meter on both an MTB and a road bike allows for easy comparison of training sessions and training load, enabling them to fit into the same training plan. However, it is crucial to ensure there is no discrepancy between the two power meters. Normalized power is used in EnduroCo to determine training load, considering the higher power volatility on the MTB. The intensity of MTB efforts, which is often higher, is not accurately reflected in average power output but can be seen from the significantly higher normalized power output.

## Workout with Heart Rate & RPE

Training with power on the road bike and heart rate on the MTB can lead to issues, especially when it comes to short, intense efforts on the MTB. Heart rate alone provides limited insight into such efforts. In this case, combining a power meter on the MTB and using only heart rate on the road bike might be a better approach. EnduroCo estimates the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) based on normalized power or, in the absence of a power meter, uses heart rate data. However, the heart rate alone is inadequate in determining the intensity of short, intense efforts.

As always, but particularly with MTB training based on heart rate, it is essential to rely on the feeling of intensity during training. When heart rate data is the only available information, the RPE number is given greater importance in calculating training load compared to when power data is also present. This allows for adjusting the training load on the MTB using a higher RPE number. By following this approach, road training with power and MTB training with heart rate data can be effectively combined into one training schedule. Nonetheless, it is still important to incorporate specific workouts aligned with individual goals.
