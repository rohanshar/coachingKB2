# Cycling Your First 100 Kilometres: Tips for Success

Cycling your first 100 kilometres is a significant milestone that requires proper training and preparation. However, it is crucial to enjoy the process and not exhaust yourself. Here are our essential tips to help you achieve this goal.

## Slowly Increase Training Duration

It is important for both novice and experienced cyclists to gradually increase the duration of their training sessions. Start with 45 to 60 minutes per workout and aim to make the longest workout each week about 10% longer. If you experience any discomfort or excessive fatigue, stay at the current training duration for an extra week.

If you want to do more, focus on training more frequently rather than extending the duration. Research suggests that recreational cyclists can improve their endurance fitness just as effectively with 2-3 hours of high-intensity training (HIT) per week as with 10-12 hours of easy endurance training.

## Incorporate Interval Training

Start incorporating interval training early on in your training regimen. This will help build confidence, improve comfort on the bike, and enhance your ability to steer and cycle at higher speeds. Begin with low-intensity intervals in the first 3 to 4 training sessions, gradually increasing the intensity over time. If you experience any issues such as discomfort in your seat or knees, consider getting a bike fitting before continuing with interval training.

After a 12-week period, your longest endurance training session should be nearly 3 hours, allowing you to complete your first 100 kilometres. It is important to maintain proper nutrition and hydration during your ride. In addition to one longer ride per week, incorporate 1 to 3 shorter training sessions with intervals. These rides can be done outdoors or indoors using platforms like Zwift. Ideally, follow a polarised training approach, alternating between easy endurance training and high-intensity sessions. Consider using a training plan provided by EnduroCo for optimal results.

## Proper Fueling with Carbohydrates

During your training and the actual 100-kilometre ride, it is crucial to consume enough carbohydrates for proper fueling. Aim to drink at least one 500ml sports drink every hour, preferably an isotonic beverage containing 20 to 35 grams of carbohydrates. Additionally, supplement this intake with 60 to 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour through food. Consuming 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour may be challenging initially, so starting with 40 to 50 grams per hour is acceptable.

## Self-Supporting and Preparedness

For your first 100-kilometre ride, consider going out with a group as it can increase speed and shorten the time spent on the bike by sharing responsibilities. However, it is essential to be self-supporting and prepared. Have a food and drink strategy in place, and learn how to change an inner tube yourself. Master these skills during the initial 12 weeks of your training.

Best of luck on your cycling journey!
