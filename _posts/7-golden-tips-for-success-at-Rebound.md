## The dos and don’ts for Rebound

## Rebound tip 1

Make sure you’ve tested all your gear before you use it on D-day. Don’t start with brand-new tires, chains, cassettes or whatever, but make sure you’ve done at least an one hour (easy) spin the day before, so you know you can rely on it. The same goes for nutrition, hydration or even stuff like bibs, water bottles or camel bags. We understand it’s pretty daddy cool to show up in or with some brand-new shining gear, but it’s more important to get at that finish line.


## Rebound tip 2

Be well rested. If you follow a training plan, which we hope you do on EnduroCo, follow the set taper period. Your form on the day is the outcome of condition minus fatigue. This taper will also ensure your carbohydrate storages in the liver and muscles are completely full, if of course you keep eating properly, with some extra carbs in run-up for Rebound.


## Rebound tip 3

Keep your stops to a minimum. Actually, one of the rules of Rebound is to keep the rest stops to a maximum of 2, but an extra advice is to make those stops not too long. Eating and drinking can be easily done on the bike instead of off the bike. Some would argue this also goes for peeing, but we leave that up to you. If, for example, you peddle for 10 minutes at 15 km/h while eating, you still tick 2,5 km. If someone needs to close that gap while you speed up to 30 km/h he or she needs to ride half an hour at 35 km/h and that’s a big effort.


## Rebound tip 4

This event might come across as a cycling event, while it’s actually an eating contest. The most limiting factor in your performance will likely be the amount of carbs you have left in your tank. You can empty the complete storage of approximately 600 grams within 60-90 minute of near threshold work and you can only replenish this with about 90 grams an hour. For this you need to eat a lot and you need to train this. Especially for really long rides this is the key in completing your challenge. The aim here is to start eating right from the get go preferably glucose and fructose in a 2:1 ratio.
